Grogu (colloquially known as "Baby Yoda" among fans and the
media) is a character from the Star Wars Disney+ original television
series The Mandalorian. He is an infant member of the same
unnamed alien species as the Star Wars characters Yoda and Yaddle,
with whom he shares a strong ability in the Force. In the series, the
protagonist known as "the Mandalorian" is hired to track down and
capture Grogu for a remnant of the fallen Galactic Empire, but instead
becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials. The
character's real name was not revealed until "Chapter 13: The Jedi",
in which it is explained that Grogu was raised at the Jedi Temple on
Coruscant during the Clone Wars. Prior to this, the character's official
name, as used in subtitles and captions, was "The Child".
Grogu has appeared in every episode of the series with the exception
of "Chapter 15: The Believer". He was created by The Mandalorian
creator and showrunner Jon Favreau based upon his desire to explore
the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further
developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive
producer Dave Filoni, and the character's imagery was defined by
concept artist Christian Alzmann. Grogu is mostly a work of
animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computergenerated imagery.
The puppet was designed by Legacy Effects and cost about $5
million to make.[1] It is controlled by two technicians, one who
operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial
expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a
combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a bateared fox and kinkajou. The dynamic between the Mandalorian and
Grogu embody a theme of parenting and fatherhood prevalent in The
Mandalorian, with the character also raising questions about good
and evil and nature versus nurture in the series.

Backstory
Grogu is a member of the same alien species as the Star Wars character Yoda.[6][7] He is 50 years old during
the events of The Mandalorian, but still appears to be an infant because of the pace at which that species
matures.[8][9][10] The species has never been given a proper name because Star Wars creator George Lucas
wanted Yoda to maintain a sense of mystery.[2][4][11] Until Chapter 13 (i.e. episode 5 of season 2) of The
Mandalorian, Grogu was not identified by a proper name, being referred to by sympathetic characters as "the
child", "the kid", or "the baby", and by the antagonists as "the asset", "the bounty", "the target", or "the
donor".[7][12] He is the only character to appear in all episodes of the series other than the titular Mandalorian
bounty hunter character, "the Mandalorian" (portrayed by Pedro Pascal).[13]

Season one
Grogu first appears in the series debut, "Chapter 1: The Mandalorian", when the Mandalorian accepts a
valuable commission from a mysterious man known only as "The Client" (Werner Herzog), who works for a
remnant of the now-fallen Galactic Empire. The assignment is to track down and capture an unidentified fiftyyear-old target.[14][15][16] The Mandalorian and a fellow bounty hunter, droid IG-11 (Taika Waititi), infiltrate a

remote and heavily defended encampment on the planet Arvala-7 and find Grogu. When IG-11 attempts to kill
Grogu, the Mandalorian protects him and instead shoots and destroys IG-11.[16][17][18] In "Chapter 2: The
Child", Grogu is present when the Mandalorian is attacked by a giant rhinoceros-like creature called a
Mudhorn. As the beast rushes toward the Mandalorian for the kill, Grogu uses the Force to levitate the
mudhorn, allowing a surprised Mandalorian to kill it.[19][20][21] The Mandalorian delivers Grogu to the Client
on the planet Nevarro and collects his bounty in "Chapter 3: The Sin", after which the Client orders his
colleague, Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), to "extract the necessary material" from Grogu.[22][23] The
Mandalorian later has second thoughts and returns to the Imperial compound to rescue Grogu, killing multiple
stormtroopers.[24][25] This violates the code of the Bounty Hunters' Guild, and a group of bounty hunters led
by guild leader Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) ambush the Mandalorian and attempt to take Grogu back from
him.[26][27][28] The Mandalorian and Grogu are saved when fellow warriors from the Mandalorian's tribe
come out of hiding to defend them, allowing them to escape Nevarro.[22][28]
In "Chapter 4: Sanctuary", the Mandalorian seeks refuge in the sparsely populated planet Sorgan. He plans to
leave Grogu in a village there under the care of a widow named Omera (Julia Jones), but after another bounty
hunter tracks them down, he realizes the planet is not safe.[29][30][31] The Mandalorian and Grogu visit the
planet Tatooine in "Chapter 5: The Gunslinger", during which the Mandalorian leaves Grogu in the care of a
mechanic named Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris). Grogu and Peli are briefly abducted by a bounty hunter named
Toro Calican (Jake Cannavale), whom the Mandalorian kills.[32] In "Chapter 6: The Prisoner", the
Mandalorian participates in a rescue job as part of a team of mercenaries organized by Ranzar Malk (Mark
Boone Junior). The Mandalorian keeps Grogu hidden on his ship during the mission, but the other mercenaries
eventually find him. One of them, a droid named Q9-0 (Richard Ayoade), learns of the bounty on Grogu and
tries to kill him, but is himself destroyed by the Mandalorian.[33][34][35] At the start of the first season's
penultimate episode, "Chapter 7: The Reckoning", the Mandalorian is contacted by Greef Karga, who says the
Client has tightened his control over Nevarro as a result of the Mandalorian's actions there. Greef proposes that
the Mandalorian help him kill the Client and eliminate the Imperial presence from the planet, and in exchange
he and Grogu will be safe from any further reprisals from the Guild.[36][37][38]
The proposal is a trap, and Greef plans to ambush and kill the Mandalorian and return Grogu to the
Client.[26][38][39] Nevertheless, the Mandalorian accepts the offer and returns to the planet along with Grogu
and his allies Cara Dune (Gina Carano), Kuiil (Nick Nolte), and the recently-rebuilt IG-11, whom Kuiil has
reprogrammed to be a nurse droid and protector for Grogu.[36][37][39] During their voyage, the party is
attacked by pterodactyl-like creatures and Greef receives what would have been a fatal injury, but Grogu uses
the Force to heal him.[37][40][41] Greef is so moved that he has a change of heart and informs the others about
the trap.[26][40][27] They devise a new plan in which Kuiil will bring Grogu back to the Mandalorian's ship,
while the others will kill the Client and his troops.[37][38][39] The plan goes wrong and Kuiil is killed by
Imperial Scout Troopers,[42][43] who briefly abduct Grogu before he is rescued by IG-11 at the start of the
first-season finale, "Chapter 8: Redemption".[44] IG-11 brings Grogu back to the Mandalorian, Cara, and
Greef and helps defend them against an ambush by the Imperial leader Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito),
who is revealed to have been seeking Grogu all along.[45][46][47] He does not reveal why he wants Grogu, but
says he "means more to me than you will ever know".[48]
After surviving an attack by Gideon's stormtroopers, during which Grogu uses the Force to deflect the fire of
an attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back against him, the group escapes with Grogu through a sewer
grate. They seek help from the hidden Mandalorian tribe, but it is revealed the Imperials wiped out the tribe
after they revealed themselves in "Chapter 3: The Sin".[49] The tribe's leader, "The Armorer" (Emily
Swallow), instructs the Mandalorian to watch over and protect Grogu,[50][51][52] who she formally adopts into
the Mandalorian culture as a "foundling", like the Mandalorian once was himself.[51][53] She instructs the
Mandalorian to seek out and deliver Grogu to the others of his kind, and that until this occurs, the Mandalorian
and Grogu are a "clan of two", and that the Mandalorian will be like a father to him.[53][54] She declares their
"signet" to be a likeness of a Mudhorn, the creature the Mandalorian and Grogu worked together to kill in

"Chapter 2: The Child".[55] The group departs, and IG-11 sacrifices himself to destroy an entire squad of
stormtroopers to protect Grogu.[45] After fending off a final attack from Moff Gideon, the Mandalorian once
again departs from Nevarro with Grogu.[49]

Season two
Grogu accompanies the Mandalorian during his search for other Mandalorians who could help him find the
former's people: the Jedi. In "Chapter 9: The Marshal", the pair return to Tatooine and meet Cobb Vanth
(Timothy Olyphant), the Marshal of Mos Pelgo, who is not a true Mandalorian, but wears Mandalorian armor.
The Mandalorian helps Vanth slay a krayt dragon which had been attacking Mos Pelgo in exchange for his
armor, along the way arranging an uneasy alliance between the townspeople and a Tusken Raider tribe, and
developing deep respect for Vanth, to the point he entrusts him to look after Grogu, should he perish during his
attempt to kill the dragon. In "Chapter 10: The Passenger", the Mandalorian and Grogu leave for Trask, where
they must take a contact, "Frog Lady" (Misty Rosas, voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), and her eggs in exchange
for a lead on other Mandalorians. During their journey, Grogu takes a liking into the eggs and eats a few of
them, even when the Mandalorian explicitly forbids him from doing so. Grogu's appetite also gets the group
into trouble while stranded on Maldo Kreis, where he eats a spider-like creature egg just as the rest of the
swarm hatches, though they are ultimately saved by two X-wing pilots (Dave Filoni and Paul Sun-Hyung
Lee) from the New Republic. In "Chapter 11: The Heiress", the group arrives on Trask and, after bringing
Frog Lady and her remaining eggs to her husband, the Mandalorian and Grogu encounter Bo-Katan Kryze
(Katee Sackhoff) and two other Mandalorian warriors, who save them from a crew of Quarrens who tried to
kill the two and steal the Mandalorian's armor. While the Mandalorian accompanies Bo-Katan's team on a
mission in exchange for a lead on Jedi, Grogu is left with the Frog Man and Frog Lady, during which time the
eggs hatch and Grogu bonds with the newborn tadpoles.
In "Chapter 12: The Siege", the Mandalorian and Grogu return to Nevarro for repairs to the Razor Crest, and
reunite with Greef Karga and Cara Dune, who have since turned the planet around. While the Mandalorian
goes with Greef, Cara and their Mythrol companion (Horatio Sanz) to destroy the last Imperial base on
Nevarro in exchange for said repairs, Grogu is left at a local school, where he uses the Force to steal some
cookies from a boy. This episode also provides a clue as to what the Empire's plans with Grogu are; while
exploring the Imperial base, the Mandalorian and the others stumble upon cloning experiments performed by
Imperial scientists, involving Grogu's blood, some of which has already been transfused to the clones to
supposedly give them Force-sensitivity.
In "Chapter 13: The Jedi", the Mandalorian takes Grogu to former Jedi Ahsoka Tano (Rosario Dawson) on
Corvus, who communicates with him through the Force, learning his name and that he is a former Jedi
youngling who was rescued from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant during the Great Jedi Purge and hidden for his
own safety, which is why he suppresses his Force powers.[56] While Ahsoka is reluctant to train Grogu
because of his strong attachment to the Mandalorian, she tells the latter to take him to the Jedi Temple on
Tython, where Grogu might reach out to another Jedi through the Force and choose his own destiny.
In "Chapter 14: The Tragedy", the Mandalorian brings Grogu to said temple, where he begins meditating,
creating a protective Force field around him. Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant, having tracked down the
Mandalorian, soon attacks in an attempt to capture Grogu, who continues his meditation while being protected
by the Mandalorian and the recently-arrived by Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and Fennec Shand's (Ming-Na
Wen), who made a deal with the former to protect Grogu in exchange for Fett's armor (which the Mandalorian
obtained from Cobb Vanth). Despite their best efforts, Grogu is captured by Gideon's Dark Troopers and taken
to his cruiser, where he is imprisoned inside a holding cell. Later, Gideon witnesses Grogu using his Force
powers on two stormtroopers that he throws around the cell, before stunning him and preparing to take him to
Dr. Pershing to complete the blood transfusion.

Characterization
Physically, Grogu closely resembles Yoda, sharing his signature green skin and long, pointed ears.[57] Grogu
is small in size, with wide eyes, short hairs, and wrinkled skin.[58][59] Grogu is capable of sitting up, crawling,
walking and eating. He appears capable of understanding some language spoken around him, but cannot
speak except in baby-like babble noises.[60] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair stated: "There is an emotional
transference happening here. The audience cares more about the unnamed, faceless Mandalorian because he
cares so much about Baby Yoda."[61] Rebecca Keegan of The Hollywood Reporter believes Grogu displays a
form of wisdom despite his young age, describing him as "a Dalai Lama in toddler form".[5] Jeanne Cavelos,
former NASA astrophysicist and author of The Science of Star Wars, also believes Grogu demonstrates
intelligence beyond his years, noting his awareness and empathy toward beings even when their faces or
bodies are covered completely, as well as his ability to recognize injury in others and attempt to repair it.[60]
Despite his youth, Grogu demonstrates a considerable ability to use and manipulate the Force, such as when
he lifts the large Mudhorn creature into the air in "Chapter 2: The Child",[19][62] and when he deflects the fire
of an attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back against him in "Chapter 8: Redemption".[49] Kevin Melrose
of Comic Book Resources noted that in the original Star Wars trilogy film The Empire Strikes Back (1980),
Luke Skywalker struggled to lift an X-wing fighter due to its large size, so the fact that Grogu can lift heavy
objects despite his diminutive size and young age demonstrates the vastness of his Force powers.[62] Grogu
also repeatedly shows a desire to use the Force to help those around him, such as when he attempts to heal the
Mandalorian's wounds in "Chapter 2: The Child",[19] and when he heals Greef Karga's near-fatal wounds in
"Chapter 7: The Reckoning".[37][40] However, after using the Force in this manner, Grogu is often exhausted
and slips into unconsciousness,[63][64][65] indicating that he is still developing his power and does not yet have
the skills to fully control it. Despite his raw natural ability with the Force, Grogu is untrained and still depends
heavily on the Mandalorian and other allies for protection.[63] Grogu has a sweet temperament,[5] and comes
across as innocent and kindhearted to most of the people he encounters,[63] but is also occasionally capable of
violence, such as during a scene in "Chapter 7: The Reckoning" when he uses the Force to choke Cara Dune
while she is engaging the Mandalorian in a friendly arm wrestling match.[66][67][68]

Concept and creation
Conception

Grogu was created by The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau (left), and the character was
developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer Dave Filoni (right).

Grogu was conceived by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian.[6] Upon learning that
Lucasfilm had been sold to the Walt Disney Company in 2012, Favreau began imagining working on a Star
Wars project, and was particularly interested in exploring the events after the original Star Wars trilogy.[5] He
conceived Grogu based upon a desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species,[6] and an interest in
presenting a character from Yoda's species at the beginning of his journey, in contrast to Yoda ending his own
journey in Return of the Jedi (1983).[5] Favreau believed part of the appeal of Yoda was that George Lucas
deliberately kept his origins and details about the species mysterious, and Favreau believed that sense of
mystery would extend to Grogu: "I think that's why people are so curious about this little one of the same
species."[6][69]
In mid-2017, shortly after Favreau pitched The Mandalorian to Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, she
suggested he meet with Dave Filoni, who had co-created several Star Wars animated series. Filoni said of his
meeting with Favreau:
When he brought up in the very beginning of doing this child and having it be of Yoda's species, I
was like, ‘Oh, that's very tricky, because there's never been this before outside of Yoda, and then
Yaddle in the prequels on the Jedi Council. It's kind of a sacred thing ... We just have to be
responsible when we're telling a story with what we're deciding to do. The fans want to know
things are a calculated, careful decision. Then if you tell a good story, most of the time they go
with it.[70]
The character of Grogu was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and Filoni, the latter of
whom drew a rough sketch of the character on cocktail napkins during the talks.[5] Multiple artists worked to
refine the image of Grogu created by Filoni, but the definitive imagery came from a concept drawing by artist
Christian Alzmann, which depicted the character's makeshift garment.[5] Favreau said of this rendering: "It
looked cute, but it also looked a little weird. That's part of Yoda. It can't just be cute. It can't just be a straightup Disney baby, it has to be a little bit tweaked."[5] The team sought to establish mannerisms and expressions
for Grogu that would remind viewers of a pet with whom they might share a connection. These characteristics
include Grogu's ears, posture, and the way he cocks his head.[5]
Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Grogu: "The moment I laid eyes on the character, I had a strong feeling that it
was going to connect with audiences. So cute, so interesting, so compelling. So familiar and yet so new."[5]
Favreau has clarified that Grogu is not a younger version of Yoda himself,[6][7][69] but has declined to
comment upon whether he is related to Yoda or otherwise connected to him.[7]

Development
Grogu is mostly a work of animatronics and puppetry, although accentuated with computer-generated imagery
(CGI).[6] Legacy Effects, the special effects studio started by protégés of special make-up effects creator Stan
Winston, designed the Grogu puppet and supplied the puppeteers to animate it during filming.[71][72] The
puppet cost about $5 million to make,[1] and is relatively heavy due to the amount of wires and animatronic
technology inside it.[73] It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another
who controls other facial expressions.[12][74] There are several stand-in versions for Grogu used in filming in
addition to the primary puppet.[75] The crew of The Mandalorian wanted to use animatronics for Grogu as
often as possible.[76] However, they also shot versions of the character's scenes both with and without the
puppet, so they had the option of replacing it with a CGI effect in post-production if the puppet did not look
satisfactory.[76][77] When CGI is used, Favreau said they try to make the character obey the same physical
laws that he would if he were a puppet, adding: "I think a lot of times CG makes itself too obvious where you
don't create parameters creatively that allow the character to keep the same identity and charm."[6]

The

sounds of Grogu were created by David Acord and Matthew Wood, sound editors with Skywalker Sound,
who had previously worked on various Star Wars projects. Acord recorded animals' noises at a wildlife rescue
near San Diego,[78] and used recordings of a bat-eared fox and kinkajou to make the initial version of Grogu's
voice.[2][78][79] However, Favreau suggested the voice needed to sound more human-like and relatable to
audiences, so instead the animal sounds were scaled back and used only for small grunts and cooing noises.
Actual infant vocals were used to create the new version of Grogu's voice, and Acord used a highly-pitched
version of his own voice for some of the more articulated vocalizations.[78] Acord also previously voiced
Rotta the Hutt, the young Huttlet son of Jabba the Hutt, in the animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars
(2008).[79]

Filming
The character was referred to as "The Child" in screenplays for The Mandalorian, though Bryce Dallas
Howard, who directed "Chapter 4: Sanctuary", said she always referred to him on set simply as "Baby",[71]
and other cast members called it "The Being".[11] During filming, the director of each episode would
communicate with Grogu's puppeteers to discuss what was happening in the scene, what emotions Grogu
should express, and what actions the character should take.[12][61] Director Deborah Chow said in this way, it
was similar to providing direction to a living actor.[61][80] Favreau encouraged the directors to test and push
the boundaries of the Grogu puppet during filming, urging them to experiment and attempt to get the most
realistic movements and mannerisms possible from the character.[71] Brendan Wayne, a body double for the
Mandalorian character, said the puppet looked so realistic that performing against it felt like working with an
actual child actor.[72] Rick Famuyiwa, the director of "Chapter 2: The Child", said he was shocked when he
learned that the premiere episode of The Mandalorian ended with the introduction of Grogu, because it meant
he would be directing the next episode that further expanded upon the character.[76]
The Grogu puppet was popular on set with the show's cast and crew.[61][81] Chow said: "With the baby, every
time it came on set, the whole crew would respond to it. Even the grip department, every production assistant
is coming to the monitors, trying to see it."[81] Howard screamed in excitement when she first saw it,[71] and
Gina Carano said of Grogu: "That was our precious. Our precious is this being that we all end up taking care
of in some way."[61] Emily Swallow said she "fell in love with it like everybody else",[82][83] adding: "I was
thrilled when they brought him in that little bag for the scene that I got to have with it. I just wanted to snuggle
it."[84][85] Amy Sedaris said the animatronic Grogu puppet made everyone on the set happy: "The minute you
looked into Baby Yoda's eyes you just got lost."[86] Likewise, Giancarlo Esposito said he enjoyed interacting
with the Grogu puppet during filming: "It melts my heart, because the reality is, this little baby does things that
you could never imagine and when you look at those eyes and that little body, how can you not help but fall in
love?"[87] Carl Weathers has said of him: "He is very interesting and very knowledgeable and very cute. I
never use that word, but he is a cute little guy."[88][89]

Werner Herzog particularly enjoyed filming scenes with the animatronic
Grogu puppet, which he called "heartbreakingly beautiful".[74][90][91] Chow
said directing the scene between Herzog and Grogu in "Chapter 3: The Sin"
was "one of the weirdest" moments of her career,[61][81][92] because he had
so much affection for the puppet and was interacting with it like it was a
living being.[81][92][93] She said: "I literally think that he had forgotten that it's
not a real-live creature and he had fallen in love with it."[92] Herzog strongly
urged the Mandalorian filmmakers to use the puppet for the character and not
CGI. While filming one scene, Dave Filoni began to remove the puppet to
shoot an alternate take, in case they decided to use a CGI version of Grogu in
its place. Herzog passionately urged him not to do so and to remain
committed to the animatronics and puppetry, saying: "You are cowards. Leave
it. Leave it."[76][77] Esposito has also said having an actual Grogu puppet to
perform against has been beneficial for the cast, because "that space allows all
of us to be so wowed by its presence".[75]

Werner Herzog, who
portrays The Client in The
Mandalorian, strongly urged
the show's producers to
remain committed to the
animatronics and puppetry
for Grogu, calling them
"cowards" for considering
using computer-generated
imagery.

Misty Rosas, who delivered the motion capture performance for Kuiil, often
held the Grogu puppet during her scenes in "Chapter 7: The Reckoning".
This occasionally proved challenging for Rosas, who also had to manage the
weight of the animatronics in her own costume and face mask, as well as the
weight of Grogu prop.[73] One full day of filming the episode focused upon
Kuiil riding the blurrg creature, a process Rosas described as "intense" due to
the amount of time she spent on the fake creature and the speeds at which it
was made to run. The process was made further challenging because she was
carrying the heavy animatronic Grogu puppet throughout the scenes, and she
occasionally needed breaks between takes. Rosas said: "My legs are not exactly long, so I was squeezing for
dear life and holding the baby."[94] Nevertheless, Rosas said she enjoyed working with Grogu character,
saying: "He just melts my heart, he's so cute."[73]
During the opening scene of "Chapter 8: Redemption", an Imperial Scout Trooper portrayed by comedian
Adam Pally punched Grogu. During the first take of filming the scene, Pally punched the animatronic Grogu
puppet hard, prompting Favreau to inform the actor that the puppet cost about $5 million to make. This made
Pally so nervous that he missed Grogu altogether when he tried to punch him in the three subsequent
takes.[95][96] Pally joked about working with Grogu: "I gotta tell you, the truth is that Baby Yoda is a bit of a
diva. He's constantly vaping."[97][98][99] At some point during filming of The Mandalorian, George Lucas
visited the set and held the Grogu puppet. Favreau posted a picture of Lucas holding Grogu on Instagram on
January 16, 2020, which drew considerable Internet attention.[100][101][102]

Prerelease
Grogu was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from The Mandalorian's prerelease marketing and
merchandise plans due to the risk that details about the character could leak before the show
aired.[6][5][103][104] Favreau said of this plan: "I think that part of what people really value is to be surprised
and delighted, and I think that's becoming all too rare."[6] Favreau has credited Donald Glover as the source of
that strategy. While developing The Mandalorian, Favreau was simultaneously directing Glover in the
photorealistic remake of The Lion King (2019). While discussing music and pop culture, Glover told Favreau
that people enjoy being surprised, because true surprises had become much less common in the Internet era.
As an example, Glover cited the excitement generated by the sudden releases of surprise albums by singer and
songwriter Beyoncé.[5][105] Favreau felt keeping Grogu a secret until he was revealed would allow fans to
connect with the character and "discover the story as it was unfolding". The leadership and marketing team at
the Walt Disney Company was supportive of this strategy.[6] Screeners of the pilot episode were not

distributed to reviewers to avoid leaks about Grogu,[106] and the official
Lucasfilm and Star Wars social media accounts did not start posting messages
about Grogu until about a week after the series debuted, to avoid spoiling the
character's debut as much as possible.[106][107][108]

Themes
Parenting and fatherhood
One of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood,
particularly through the father-son relationship dynamic between the
Mandalorian and Grogu.[109][110][111] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote: "For
Jon Favreau has credited
years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parent-child dynamic. With
actor Donald Glover
Mando and Baby Yoda, that’s finally changing."[109] Vulture writer Kathryn
(pictured) with inspiring the
VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars
decision to keep Grogu's
stories, but almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an
revelation a secret.
infant in early developmental stages such as Grogu. As examples, she cited
Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker,
Princess Leia lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents.[112] Several reviewers
have compared the dynamic between Grogu and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a
samurai warrior and his young son.[113][114][115][116] Grogu makes the Mandalorian a softer and more
relatable character;[8][117] he changes in a positive way because of raising Grogu, becoming less selfish and
self-absorbed.[118] Several examples of the Mandalorian parenting Grogu appear throughout the series, such
as when he stops Grogu from pressing random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship,
ultimately by holding him in his lap.[109] In another example, the Mandalorian sets up a car seat for Grogu in
the cockpit of his ship, so he can be seated safely and comfortably during their travels.[119]
The relationship between the Mandalorian and Grogu is an example of unexpected fatherhood.[112][118] The
Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with Grogu because of his own childhood, when he was
orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a "foundling".[112]
Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial
attempts to avoid this responsibility. He first does so in "Chapter 3: The Sin", when he leaves Grogu with the
Client,[118] and then again in "Chapter 4: Sanctuary", when he plans to leave Grogu with Omera, a protective
mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take Grogu into her own family. The Mandalorian does not fully
commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, "Chapter 8: Redemption", when Grogu himself is
also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a "foundling" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his
father figure.[112]
Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are
portrayed in the series: "There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no
uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent’s psyche like a dentist’s drill shredding a soft, pink
nerve."[61] Likewise, Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many
parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what Grogu eats, when he goes to sleep, and whether
he wears diapers. She wrote: "The Mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very
particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff."[112] VanAnderonk
described this as a wish fulfillment fantasy for parents or prospective parents: "a vision of parenting stripped so
thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that’s left are archetypes: the parent, the child".[112]

Grogu encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and
Peli Motto.[112] Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves
Grogu alone or in the hands of relative strangers,[110] as well as for making decisions that place Grogu in
danger. One example is in "Chapter 6: The Prisoner", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use
his ship while Grogu is on board, nearly resulting in Grogu's death.[110][120] An interaction the Mandalorian
has with Peli Motto in "Chapter 5: The Gunslinger" is one of the most overt discussions about the challenges
of caring for Grogu. When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes Grogu, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms,
she chides him: "Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?"[112] She also condemns the
Mandalorian for leaving Grogu alone on the ship, saying: "you have an awful lot to learn about raising a
young one".[32] ScreenCrush writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors make the show that
much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.[110]

Good and evil; nature versus nurture
One scene in "Chapter 7: The Reckoning" led many fans to reevaluate Grogu and question whether he may
demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, Grogu observes as the
Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly arm wrestling match. During the contest, Grogu uses the
Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling her before the Mandalorian intervenes.[66][67][68] Throughout the Star
Wars franchise, that ability has been most commonly associated with the dark side of the Force, and
particularly with the antagonist character Darth Vader.[121][122] Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: "The
moment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little disturbing."[121] Some reviewers noted, however, that
Grogu likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian was in danger and intervened to help.[122][123]
Additionally, in the same episode, Grogu uses the Force to heal and save Greef Karga, a power typically
associated with the Light Side.[121][66][123] Peter Foy of Comic Book Resources wrote: "It doesn't exactly
seem realistic that Disney would blow its merchandising potential with the little cutie by going all Damien
(The Omen) in his storyline."[66]
Nevertheless, some writers have suggested viewers had been underestimating Grogu's capacity for evil
because he is cute.[68][122][124] Fans speculated Grogu could be presenting a false personality or using the
Force to manipulate people into caring about him to help ensure his survival.[67] Esquire writer Matt Miller
noted that Yoda lied about his identity during his initial appearance in The Empire Strikes Back, posing as a
simple-minded observer to Luke Skywalker before revealing himself to be a Jedi Master. Miller suggested
Grogu could be putting on a similar performance.[122] One fan theory suggests Grogu could be related to a
prophecy in a past Star Wars work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy,
described in the novel Star Wars: Master and Apprentice (2019), says: "The danger of the past is not past, but
sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire." Fans theorized this could refer to
Grogu, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in The Mandalorian.[124] Others have theorized the reason the
Imperial remnant wants Grogu is to turn him over to the dark side of the Force,[121] or for use as a weapon.[66]
Moff Gideon in the season finale says, "You may think you have some idea what you’re in possession of, but
you do not." Peter Foy of Comic Book Resources suggested this could allude to Grogu's potential to cause
mass destruction.[66]
Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle suggested rather than building toward Grogu becoming evil, the show could be
suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise Grogu in a less violent environment.[67] All season
long, Grogu has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.[121][67] For example, Vulture writer
Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, Grogu has a "look of
wonder" in his eyes, which Phipps said "is hilarious, but also a little chilling".[46] Some writers applied a
nature versus nurture argument to this, contending Grogu is becoming violent because of what he is learning
based on the actions around him.[67] This suggests Grogu is not inherently good or evil,[121][66] but that
instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

He is learning about life and needs guidance as he develops his abilities.[120][121] This is why he uses Force
powers generally associated with both the light and dark sides of the Force.[66] It will largely fall to the
Mandalorian to provide this guidance,[120] as when the Mandalorian stops him from strangling Cara.[121]

Cultural impact
Critical reception
Grogu has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers,[4][61] and is widely considered the show's
breakout character.[2][3][125][126] Fans immediately adopted the nickname "Baby Yoda" to describe the
character,[7][127][128] a moniker Favreau has embraced as "the easiest, shortest, most hashtagable way to
identify that character".[7] However, the nickname is not used internally by the crew of The Mandalorian, and
Disney CEO Bob Iger said he "got [his] wrist slapped" by Favreau for calling the character Baby Yoda in email messages.[129][130] Iger later said the scale of the positive reaction to Grogu was "beyond my
expectations by a wide margin".[131][132]
Several writers described Grogu as a pop culture phenomenon, particularly noting the adoration it had received
from fans on social media.[4][12][61] The Guardian called Baby Yoda "2019's biggest new character",[4] and
Bryan Alexander of USA Today wrote: "There's nothing hotter in the universe than Baby Yoda."[7] Some
critics noted that fandom for Grogu transcended age and experience, and that few fictional characters unite
entire fan bases in the way Grogu had;[61][133] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair wrote: "In an era of bitter
division on nearly all matters, there is seemingly unanimous adoration for this tiny alien creature."[61][134]
Vox writer Allegra Frank said Grogu made The Mandalorian "instantly more memorable and evocative", and
alleviated the solitude and tension that might otherwise have surrounded the show's protagonist.[8] Carolyn
Giardina of The Hollywood Reporter said Grogu helped The Mandalorian not only achieve critical and
commercial success, but also impact the cultural zeitgeist.[6] Beyond the show, other writers have described the
character as a key component in the success of Disney's rollout of the Disney+ streaming service.[4][135][136]
Julia Alexander of The Verge wrote: "There's no question that Baby Yoda is driving interest in Disney+".[135]
Some critics called Grogu one of the best and most lauded new Star Wars characters in recent
memory,[108][131] while others said the character had made the Star Wars franchise relevant to an even wider
range of audiences.[4][69]
Vulture writer Madison Malone Kircher described Grogu as an example of a character so popular that his fame
nearly eclipsed that of his own franchise, comparing him to Baby Groot from the Guardians of the Galaxy
films.[58] The Guardian writer Zach Vasquez noted past Star Wars works had featured young characters that
have not resonated as strongly as Grogu, so he credited his success with the character's designers and special
effects.[4] Likewise, Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter said the positive response to Grogu, along with
that of the show The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, demonstrate that audiences still desire puppetry,
animatronics, and practical effects rather than only CGI. Bahr wrote: "If Baby Yoda were entirely 3D
animation, he wouldn't have become an icon the minute we laid our eyes on him."[59]
Grogu was featured on the cover of the December 2019 issue of The Hollywood Reporter, along with the
headline: "Baby Yoda represents the future of Hollywood".[5] In an article in the magazine, writer Rebecca
Keegan argued Grogu is the culmination of several shifts and trends in the entertainment industry over the
decade prior to the release of The Mandalorian. These include the decline of the traditional movie star, the
growth of streaming media services, the rise of Internet culture, and technological advances in CGI.[5] Variety
writer Caroline Framke said she fell in love with the character even despite acknowledging that he is an
"inherently manipulative product of the most powerful media conglomerate".[137]

Not all reviews of Grogu were positive. An online report conducting an analysis of which U.S. states
responded most positively to Grogu, finding that interest in him was highest in Utah, and lowest in
Mississippi.[138] Rolling Stone writer Alan Sepinwall said the reveal of Grogu was a rehash of the appearance
of Rotta the Hutt in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.[139] Emily VanDerWerff of Vox described the character as
"yet another merchandising opportunity" and did not feel the character was worth Disney attempting to keep
secret before his reveal.[140] BBC writer Caryn James said he did not believe anyone without an emotional
attachment to Star Wars would care about Grogu.[141] Jeremy Gordon of The Outline called Grogu the
"product of a merciless capitalist machine" intended primarily to generate merchandising revenue for Disney.
Gordon wrote: "It's not really Baby Yoda I hate, of course. He's really cute. It's the feeling that I'm being
pandered to, that all of this is a foregone conclusion."[142] Emma Gray Ellis wrote that there was some
backlash to Grogu on social media in response to the character's massive Internet popularity. She wrote:
"There's something grindingly, performatively grouchy in leaping forward to damn something that 'everyone'
likes, in no small part because everyone likes it."[125] Grogu ranked first on several Screen Rant lists about the
series, including the most interesting characters from the first season of The Mandalorian,[27] the best
characters from the show,[143] and the best costumes from the first season.[144]

Internet memes
Grogu quickly became a popular Internet meme.[127][145][146] In the week following the debut of The
Mandalorian, Grogu was driving almost twice as many social media interactions on news stories about it as
any of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.[6][147][148] The Baby Yoda search term saw continuous
growth on Google Trends in the weeks following the release of The Mandalorian.[58] There were 2.28 million
social media interactions about the characters on news stories in the first two weeks after the release of The
Mandalorian,[148] and 2 million tweets featuring the words "Baby Yoda" were sent on Twitter between
November 12 and December 5, 2019.[58] When Favreau tweeted a concept art image of the character by artist
Christian Alzmann on November 19, it received more than 34,000 retweets and 217,000 likes within one
week.[61] Various celebrities have tweeted about the character, including Ariana Grande,[58] Elon Musk,[149]
Dwayne Johnson, Russell Wilson, Alex Rodriguez,[145] and Donald Trump Jr.[150] Zach Vasquez of The
Guardian wrote: "It's now practically impossible to scroll through any social media platform without being
inundated with pics, videos, memes and gifs of the bug-eyed, big-eared tot."[4] The Los Angeles Times
included Grogu in its list of "2019's Internet Obsessions", with writer Christie D'Zurilla writing: "Baby Yoda
won the Internet in 2019."[149]
One of the more popular memes involved a screenshot from "Chapter 4: Sanctuary" in which Grogu casually
sips from a mug of soup,[58][151] which has been compared to a similar meme of Kermit the Frog passiveaggressively sipping a glass of tea.[152][153][154] Another popular meme used a scene from that episode in
which Grogu randomly presses buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship,[58][155] with most of the
memes changing the audio so that it appeared Grogu was trying to put various songs on the radio.[155][156] In
late November 2019, the online GIF database Giphy temporarily removed its GIFs of Grogu due to
"confusion" over the legal status of the images, sparking outrage among fans. However, they were quickly
restored,[157][158][159] and Giphy issued an apology to Disney for having removed them.[157][158] Various
sports teams have created their own memes with Grogu, including Los Angeles Clippers, New York Islanders,
Phoenix Suns, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco Giants, Sacramento Kings, Seattle Mariners, and Tennessee
Volunteers football.[145]

because it can become a toy or a game or a consumer product of
some sort",[171] and he described the wait to unveil Grogu as
"worth it".[131][132] The Amazon product research tool Jungle
Scout projected that Disney may have lost $2.7 million in revenue because of the delay in release merchandise
of Grogu;[172] demand for toys of Grogu were so high that Amazon customers searched for Baby Yoda
products more than 90,000 times in one month.[173] David Lazarus, consumer columnist for the Los Angeles
Times, said he understood Disney's strategy, but felt the company missed out on significant commercial
opportunity: "The fact that they didn't anticipate that this was going to be a commercial goldmine is insane,
and that they let this opportunity slip away strikes me as sheer madness."[103]
Due to the scarcity of licensed merchandise of Grogu, many unlicensed products featuring the character were
created and sold through the Internet, including via websites like Etsy.[61][103][174] These included felt and
crocheted dolls, shirts, jewellery, Christmas ornaments, art prints, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, and
more.[61][174] Do it yourself videos were also produced showing how fans could make their own toys based
upon Grogu.[103] The top 47 unofficial Grogu products by Amazon merchants sold an average of 1,842
pieces of merchandise in the month following the show's release, at an average of $23 per product.[173] In
mid-January 2020, Disney issued takedown notices against several Etsy sellers using the words "Star Wars",
"Mandalorian", and "Yoda", citing copyright violations.[100][175][176] Official soft goods such as T-shirts were
the first to be made available because they were the easiest to produce.[7][61] The first two official dolls of
Grogu released were a 10-inch Funko figurine and an 11-inch plush toy from Mattel,[177] which began

shipping in February.[103] Pre-orders for the Funko doll made it the top toy on Amazon upon its release.[130]
More official merchandise is expected to be released in early 2020.[58][173][178] In December 2019, the
Electronic Arts video game The Sims 4 added "The Child Statue" as a purchasable decoration.[179]
Several toys of Grogu were announced American International Toy Fair in New York City in February
2020,[180][181] most notably a nearly life-sized animatronic Grogu toy by Hasbro, which moves, blinks, and
makes sounds like the actual character.[126][180] The toy sold out within days of its announcement, with new
deliveries not expected until December 2020.[182] Other toys announced at the Fair include a Grogu waffle
iron,[183] Chia Pets of Grogu,[184] and a vehicle set as part of Hasbro's Mission Fleet toyline, which include
the Mandalorian on a speeder bike and Grogu in his floating bassinet.[181] Build-A-Bear Workshop has also
announced it will release a version of a Grogu doll in early 2020.[185] Lego has announced plans for an
August 2020 release of BrickHeadz figures of both Grogu and the Mandalorian, as well as a September 2020
release of a Lego set for the Mandalorian's Razor Crest spaceship, which will include a small figurine of
Grogu.[186] In March 2020, an unofficial user-created mod for the video game Star Wars Battlefront II allowed
the character BB-8 to be replaced with a playable version of Grogu.[187][188][189] Grogu appears in Fortnite
Battle Royale as a pet that floats behind the player in-game. [190] He is the final reward of the Chapter 2 Season 5 Battle Pass.
