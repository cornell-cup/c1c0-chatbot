Star Wars
Star Wars is an American epic space opera[1] media franchise created by George Lucas,
which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture
phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including
television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas,
comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] The franchise holds a Guinness World
Records title for the "Most successful film merchandising franchise."[3] In 2020, the Star Wars
franchise's total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highestgrossing media franchise of all time.
The original film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the
sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
(1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. A prequel trilogy was later released, consisting
of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to
Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently produced sequel
trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi
(2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Together, the three trilogies form what
has been referred to as the "Skywalker saga". All nine films were nominated for Academy
Awards (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially successful.
Together with the theatrical live action spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the
combined box office revenue of the films equates to over US$10 billion,[4] and it is currently
the second-highest-grossing film franchise.[5]

Premise
The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away",[6] in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with
robots, or 'droids', who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is
common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[7][8][9] Spacecraft range from small
starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations such as the
moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual
screens, and holographic projections.
A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as "an energy field
created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together".[10] Through training and
meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" are able to perform various superpowers
(such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[11] The
Force is wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi,
peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through nonattachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and
aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are
intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[12]
Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the average population. The Jedi
and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a lightsaber, a blade of energy that can cut through
virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades
and soldiers, use laser-powered blaster firearms. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime
syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both
gangsters and governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.

Fictional timeline
The Star Wars canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, including three focused around
each of the film trilogies:[13]

The Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as
'Legends' on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films and The Clone Wars film and television
series.[2]

Film
The Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, which are collectively referred to as the "Skywalker saga".[23] They
were produced non-chronologically, with Episodes IV–VI (the original trilogy) being released between 1977 and 1983, Episodes I–III
(the prequel trilogy) being released between 1999 and 2005, and Episodes VII–IX (the sequel trilogy), being released between 2015 and
2019. Each trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family. The original trilogy depicts the heroic development
of Luke Skywalker, the prequels tell the backstory of his father Anakin, while the sequels star Luke's nephew, Kylo Ren.

An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the
production of the sequel trilogy,[24] described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as
origin stories.[25] The first entry, Rogue One (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the
Death Star plans just before Episode IV.[26][27] Solo (2018) focuses on Han Solo's backstory, also
featuring original trilogy co-protagonists Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian and involving prequel
trilogy villain Darth Maul.
Lucasfilm has a number of Star Wars movies in development, including a trilogy which will be
written by The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson[28] and be independent from the Skywalker
saga.[29] Additionally, a film based on the Knights of the Old Republic video games was reported
to be in development with Laeta Kalogridis writing the script.[30] In September 2019, it was
announced that Kennedy and Kevin Feige will collaborate to develop a Star Wars film.[31] In
January 2020, a film set in the era of The High Republic was reported to be in development.[32] In
February 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and writer
Matt Owens.[33] In May 2020, Lucasfilm announced that Taika Waititi had been hired to direct a
Star Wars film from a script he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.[34]

The lightsaber and the blaster are
iconic elements of the franchise.

Original trilogy

The original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), and Carrie Fisher
(Princess Leia).

In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing
his own space opera.[47][f] After directing American Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to
invest in.[48][49][50] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.[51] The 1977 movie's success led Lucas to
make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.[52] With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a
trilogy of trilogies.[53] Most of the main cast would return for the two additional installments of the original trilogy, which were selffinanced by Lucasfilm.
Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope in the 1979 book The Art of Star Wars.[54]
Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in
the trilogy, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi was released on May 25, 1983. The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke Skywalker's
quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent Darth Vader, and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy
from the clutches of the Galactic Empire.
Prequel trilogy

The prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padmé Amidala), and Hayden
Christensen (Anakin Skywalker).[g]

According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.[55] In
1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,[56] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided
to cancel further sequels by 1981.[57] In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it
exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept
telling myself I would make other movies someday."[58]
Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas
to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive."[59] In
1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.[60] A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "updated"
the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.
Episode I: The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, and Episode II: Attack of the Clones on May 16, 2002. Episode III:
Revenge of the Sith, the first PG-13 film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005.[61] The first two movies were met with mixed
reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. The trilogy begins 32 years before Episode IV and follows the Jedi
training of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well
as the corruption of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth Sidious. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has
collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".[62]
Sequel trilogy
Prior to releasing the original film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned "three trilogies of nine films."[53][63] He announced
this to Time in 1978,[64] and confirmed that he had outlined them in 1981.[65] At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was
to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic,[66] the return of Luke in a role similar to that of Obi-Wan in the original trilogy,[63] Luke's
sister (not yet determined to be Leia),[55] Han, Leia,[67] R2-D2 and C-3PO.[53][68] However, after beginning work on the prequel
trilogy, Lucas insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.[69][70]

The sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac
(Poe Dameron).

Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more Star
Wars films.[71] In October of that year, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that Episode VII would be
released in 2015.[72] The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president of the company and served as executive
producer of new Star Wars feature films.[73] Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,[74] but
in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.[75][76] The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the existing Star
Wars Expanded Universe, which was discarded from canon to give "maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an
element of surprise and discovery for the audience."[2]
Episode VII: The Force Awakens was released on December 16, 2015, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi on December 13, 2017, and
Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker on December 18, 2019, in many countries.[h] Episode VII was met with both critical and box office
success, and Episode VIII, while also meeting critical and financial success, had a mixed reception from audiences.[77] Episode IX
received a mixed reception from critics and fans, although audiences leaned more positively.[78] The sequel trilogy starts 30 years after
Episode VI and focuses on the journey of the Force-sensitive orphan Rey, guided by Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn
and ace X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, Rey helps the Resistance, led by Leia, fight the First Order, commanded by Han and Leia's son
(and Luke's nephew), Kylo Ren.

Anthology films
Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the Star Wars anthology series[26] (though the
word anthology has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional "A Star Wars Story" subtitle). Focused on how
the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film, Rogue One, was released on December
16, 2016, to favorable reviews and box office success. The second, Solo, centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca and Lando as
supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018, to generally favorable reviews and underperformance at the box office. Despite
this, more anthology films are expected to be released,[79] following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker.[80]

Television
The Star Wars franchise has been spun off to various television productions, including two animated series released in the mid-1980s.
Further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the Clone Wars. After Disney's acquisition
of Lucasfilm, only the later one remained canon. Three live-action Star Wars series will be released on Disney+. The first, The
Mandalorian, premiered on November 12, 2019. Star Wars won the 2020 Webby Award for Television & Film in the category
Social.[81]

In other media
From 1976 to 2014, the term Expanded Universe (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed Star Wars storytelling material set
outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.[105] Lucasfilm maintained internal
continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the
EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints
would be rebranded under the Star Wars Legends label,[105] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game The
Old Republic the only Legends material to still be produced. The Star Wars canon was subsequently restructured to only include the
existing six feature films, the animated film The Clone Wars (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative
developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm
created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.[2] Multiple comics series from Marvel and
novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement.

Print media
Star Wars in print predates the release of the first film, with the December 1976 novelization of Star Wars, initially subtitled "From the
Adventures of Luke Skywalker". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.[106] The first "Expanded Universe" story
appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's
sequel novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following month.
Novels
After penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978). The
novelizations of The Empire Strikes Back (1980) by Donald F. Glut and Return of the Jedi (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as
The Han Solo Adventures trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian Daley,[107] and The Adventures of Lando Calrissian trilogy (1983) by L. Neil
Smith.[108][109]
Timothy Zahn's bestselling Thrawn trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand
Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.[110][111][112][113] The first novel, Heir to the Empire, reached #1 on
the New York Times Best Seller list,[114] and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is
plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.[115] In The Courtship of Princess Leia (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before
the Thrawn trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately
marry.[116][117] Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire (1996), set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, was part of a
multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.[118][119] The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor,
another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.[118][120] Other notable series from Bantam include the Jedi
Academy trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson,[121][122] the 14-book Young Jedi Knights series (1995–1998) by Anderson and
Rebecca Moesta,[122][123] and the X-wing series (1996–2012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.[124][125][126]

Del Rey took over Star Wars book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment
novel series called The New Jedi Order (1999–2003). Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25
to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting
to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.[127][128] The bestselling multi-author series Legacy of the
Force (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the
Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although no
longer canon, the story is paralleled in The Force Awakens with Han and Leia's son Ben Solo, who has
become the dark Kylo Ren.[129][130][131][132]
Three series set in the prequel era were introduced for younger audiences: the 18-book Jedi Apprentice
(1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years
before The Phantom Menace; the 11-book Jedi Quest (2001–2004) follows Obi-Wan and his own
apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones; and the 10book The Last of the Jedi (2005–2008), set almost immediately after Revenge of the Sith, features ObiWan and the last few surviving Jedi.

Timothy Zahn authored the
Thrawn trilogy, which was
widely credited with
revitalizing the dormant Star
Wars franchise.

Although Thrawn had been designated a Legends character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the
canon in the 2016 third season of Rebels, with Zahn returning to write more novels based in the character, and set in the new
canon.[133][134]

Marvel Comics published a Star Wars comic book series from 1977 to 1986.[135][136][137][138] Original Star Wars comics were
serialized in the Marvel magazine Pizzazz between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original Star Wars stories not
directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series.[139] From 1985 to 1987,
the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.[140][141][142] According to
Marvel comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and
1978.[143] Marvel's Star Wars series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[144] The only downside for Marvel
was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a
position of strength.[145]
In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new Star Wars comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and
published as the popular Dark Empire series (1991–1995).[146] Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original
film trilogy, including Tales of the Jedi (1993–1998), X-wing Rogue Squadron (1995–1998), Star Wars: Republic (1998–2006), Star
Wars Tales (1999–2005), Star Wars: Empire (2002–2006), and Knights of the Old Republic (2006–2010).[147][148]
After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the Star Wars comics license would return to
Marvel Comics,[149] whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.[150] Launched in 2015, the first
three publications were titled Star Wars, Darth Vader, and the limited series Princess Leia.[151][152][153]
First announced as Project Luminous at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, full details of a publishing initiative called Star Wars: The
High Republic were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the current officially licensed publishers,
a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga will be explored in various books and comics. These include ongoing titles by
Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively, that will both premiere in August 2020.[154]

Audio
Soundtracks and singles
John Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with The Rise of
Skywalker.[155] He also composed Han Solo's theme for Solo: A Star Wars Story; John Powell adapted and composed the rest of the
score.[156] Michael Giacchino composed the score of Rogue One.[156] Williams also created the main theme for Galaxy's Edge.[157]
Audio novels
The first Star Wars audio work is The Story of Star Wars, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell
the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on
CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.[158]
Radio

Radio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the
University of Southern California, licensed the Star Wars radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. The production used John Williams's
original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.[159][160]
The first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in
1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.[161][159][160] Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film
roles.[161][159]
The overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back debuted in 1983.[162] Billy Dee Williams joined
the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.[163]
In 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute Star Wars audio drama titled Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell, written by
Daley.[160][164] In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several Star Wars series from Dark Horse Comics into audio
dramas: the three-part Dark Empire saga, Tales of the Jedi, Dark Lords of the Sith, the Dark Forces trilogy, and Crimson Empire
(1998).[164] Return of the Jedi was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.[159][164]

Video games
The Star Wars franchise has spawned over one hundred[165] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest
home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe
(rebranded as Star Wars Legends and removed from the canon in 2014). Star Wars games have gone through three significant
development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation
of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.
Early licensed games (1979–1993)
The first officially licensed electronic Star Wars game was Kenner's 1979 table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command.[166][167] In
1982, Parker Brothers published the first Star Wars video game for the Atari 2600, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,[168] followed
soon the year later by Star Wars: Jedi Arena, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari's
rail shooter arcade game Star Wars, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.[169] The next
game, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984), has more traditional raster graphics,[170] while the following Star Wars: The Empire Strikes
Back (1985) has vector graphics.[171]
Platform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive Star Wars (1987), an international
Star Wars (1991), and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992). Super Star Wars (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.
LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)
Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat
games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative
control over the games, and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex
narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and
CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released Star Wars: X-Wing, the first self-published Star Wars video game and the first space flight
simulator based on the franchise.[172] It was one of the best-selling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.[172]
The Rogue Squadron series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.
Dark Forces (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,[173] was the first Star Wars first-person shooter.[174]
It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game
engine, the Jedi.[174][173][175][176] The game was well received,[177][178][179] and it was followed by four sequels.[180][181] The series
introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.[182] Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the
Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,[174][183][184] a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.[129] A massively multiplayer
online role-playing game, Star Wars Galaxies, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts
ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.[185]
EA Star Wars (2014–present)
Following its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are
considered canonical, and feature more influence from the Star Wars filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the
augmented reality video game Jedi Challenges, released in November 2017.[186][187] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga
would publish free-to-play Star Wars mobile games.[188] The Battlefront games received a canonical reboot in 2017. Jedi: Fallen Order
was released in November 2019 and Star Wars: Squadrons was released in October 2020.

Theme park attractions
In addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live
attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the travelling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain
spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time A Galactic Spectacular. An immersive themed area
called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019.[189] A themed hotel, Star Wars:
Galactic Starcruiser, is currently under construction at Walt Disney World.[190]

Multimedia projects
A multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media. Shadows of the Empire (1996) was a multimedia project
set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that included a novel by Steve Perry, a comic book series, a video game,
and action figures.[118][119] The Force Unleashed (2008–2010) was a similar project set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope
that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a graphic novel, a role-playing game supplement, and toys.[191][192]

Merchandising
The success of the Star Wars films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the
original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the
franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue.[193] By 2012, the

first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in merchandising revenue.[194]
Kenner made the first Star Wars action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and
today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action
figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.[195] Star Wars was the first
intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.[196] Lego has produced animated parody short films
and mini-series to promote their Star Wars sets.[197] The Lego Star Wars video games are critically
acclaimed bestsellers.[198][199]
In 1977, the board game Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star was released.[200][j] A Star Wars
Monopoly and themed versions of Trivial Pursuit and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated
versions released in subsequent years. The board game Risk has been adapted in two editions by
Hasbro: The Clone Wars Edition (2005)[202] and the Original Trilogy Edition (2006).[203] Three Star
Wars tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s
and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.

George Lucas made much
of his fortune by retaining
his rights to the franchise's
merchandising.

Star Wars Trading Cards have been published since the first "blue" series, by Topps, in 1977.[204]
Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each
card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare "promos", such as the
1993 Galaxy Series II "floating Yoda" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most "base" or "common card" sets are
plentiful, many "insert" or "chase cards" are very rare.[205] From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and
produced the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.

Themes
Star Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as "the shadow".[206] There are also many
references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the
devil.[207] Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the "Chosen One", a messianic individual. However, unlike
Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until Return of the Jedi. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain
Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is "doing what he thinks is right".[208] George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is
redemption.[209]
The saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[207]
Each character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.[210]
A defining step of the journey is "Atonement with the Father".[211] Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his
relationship with Anakin,[212] whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.[213] Luke's discovery that Vader is his
father has strong repurcussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.[214] Supreme Leader
Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.[208] Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark
side.[215] According to Inverse, the final scene in The Last Jedi, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy
using the Force, symbolizes that "the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings."[216]

Historical influences
Political science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between
democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent
the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.[217][218] Darth Vader's design
was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet.[219][220] Originally, Lucas conceived of the
Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the Schutzstaffel served Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one
character in the form of Vader.[221] Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German "shock" troopers. Imperial officers wear
uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II,[222] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS
down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War II terms were used for names in the films; e.g. the planets Kessel (a
term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).[223]
Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors,[224] and
space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights.[225]
Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself
Führer.[222] Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like
Richard Nixon.[226][227][k] The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.[229] The corruption of the
Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[230][231]

On the inspiration for the First Order formed "from the ashes of the Empire", The Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams spoke of
conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and "started working together
again."[21]

The aerial warfare of The
flag
and
WWII inspired the iconography of the
space fights
Empire resembles
those of the Nazi
Party and Germany
during its rule.

Cultural impact
The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[232] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in
everyday life.[233] Phrases like "evil empire" and "May the Force be with you" have become part of the popular lexicon.[234] The first
Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[235] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[236] The film can be said to have helped
launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[237] The
widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs,
The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken: Star Wars.
In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being
"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[238] The Empire Strikes Back, was selected in 2010.[239][240] 35mm reels of the
1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original
prints,[241][242] but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.[243]

Industry
The original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three
weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits
were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.[225] The franchise helped Fox to
change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[244]
Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from
deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as
changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before Star Wars, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced
since the 1950s.[245] The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[244] Along
with Jaws, Star Wars started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many
screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[246][236] It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that
merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[235]
Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, "Like The Birth of a Nation and Citizen Kane, Star Wars was a technical
watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after." It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion
pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build
upon.[247] Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s
and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[225][248][249]
Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as The
Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one
and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[250] One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained,
"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New
Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-

glass."[250][251] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at
all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect",
which was "a kind of rebirth".[249]
The original Star Wars trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[252] Numerous filmmakers have been
influenced by Star Wars, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,[253] David Fincher, Joss
Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,[247] and later Star Wars directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.[254] Lucas's concept of a
"used universe" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and Alien (1979), James Cameron's Aliens (1986) as well as
The Terminator (1984), George Miller's Mad Max 2 (1981), and Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003).[247]
Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film Inception.[255]
Fan works
The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has
ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards,
officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the
contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were
originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[256] Lucasfilm has
allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.[257]

Academia
As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning
resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes
from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.[258] Others have used the films to
encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.[259] Similarly,
psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of
psychopathology.[260][261]

Notes
a. The film's release was preceded by its novelization in November 1976.
b. Most existing spin-off media was made non-canon and rebranded as 'Legends' in April 2014.[2]
c. The prequels feature a relatively sleek and new design aesthetic in comparison to the original trilogy.[14]
d. The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucas's depiction of a "used universe".[17]
e. The sequel trilogy made a return to what J. J. Abrams called "the wonderful preposterousness" of practical effects that
were used to create the original trilogy.[20]
f. Lucas started by researching the inspiration behind Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon comic, leading him to the works of
author Edgar Rice Burroughs—the John Carter of Mars series in particular.[47]
g. Played by Jake Lloyd as a child in Episode I
h. Each film was released two days later in the U.S.
i. The short premiered on the German Star Wars Kids YouTube channel before the American channel on October
28.[90][91]
j. Not to be confused with the board game with the same name published in 1990[201]
k. In his early drafts, Lucas used the plot point of a dictator staying in power with the support of the military. In his
comment (made in the prequel trilogy era) Lucas attributed this to Nixon's supposed intention to defy the 22nd
Amendment,[228] but the president resigned and never ran for a third term.
