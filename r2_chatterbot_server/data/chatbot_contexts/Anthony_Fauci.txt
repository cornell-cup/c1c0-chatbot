Anthony Fauci
Anthony Stephen Fauci ( /ˈfaʊtʃi/; born December 24, 1940) is
an American physician and immunologist who has served as the
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID) since 1984. Since January 2020, he has been
one of the lead members of the Trump administration's White
House Coronavirus Task Force addressing the COVID-19
pandemic in the United States. Fauci is one of the world's
leading experts on infectious diseases, and during the early
stages of the pandemic, The New Yorker and The New York
Times described Fauci as one of the most trusted medical figures
in the United States.[1][2][3][4]
As a physician with the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
Fauci has served American public health in various capacities for
more than 50 years, and has been an advisor to every U.S.
president since Ronald Reagan.[3] He has made contributions to
HIV/AIDS research and other immunodeficiency diseases, both
as a scientist and as the head of the NIAID at the NIH.[5] From
1983 to 2002, Fauci was one of the world's most frequently-cited
scientists across all scientific journals.[5] In 2008, President
George W. Bush awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, for his
work on the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR.
On December 4, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced that
Fauci would, in addition to remaining in his role as director of
the NIAID, serve as Chief Medical Advisor to the President in
the Biden administration.[6]

Fauci's paternal grandparents, Antonino Fauci and Calogera Guardino, were from Sciacca, Italy. His maternal
grandmother, Raffaella Trematerra, from Naples, Italy, was a seamstress. His maternal grandfather, Giovanni
Abys, was born in Switzerland and was an artist, noted for landscape and portrait painting, magazine
illustrations (Italy) as well as graphic design for commercial labels, including olive oil cans. His grandparents
emigrated from Italy to the United States in the late 19th century. Fauci grew up Catholic,[7][8] but now
considers himself a humanist.[9]
Fauci went to Regis High school. Fauci played the sport of basketball. Fauci attended Regis High School in Manhattan's Upper East Side, where he captained the school's basketball
team despite standing only 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall.[10][11][5] After graduating from high school in 1958, Fauci
attended the College of the Holy Cross, graduating in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in classics with a
pre-med track. Fauci then attended medical school at Cornell University Medical College where he graduated
first in his class with a Doctor of Medicine in 1966.[7] He completed an internship and residency in internal
medicine at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, now known as New York Presbyterian/Weill
Cornell Medicine.[5]

Career
In 1968, Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a
clinical associate in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI) at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.[12] In 1974,
he became head of the Clinical Physiology Section, LCI, and in
1980 was appointed Chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation.
In 1984, he became director of NIAID, a position he still holds as of

responsible for an extensive research portfolio of basic and applied
research on infectious and immune-mediated illnesses.[12] He has
turned down several offers to lead his agency's parent, the NIH, and
has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to contend with viral diseases
like HIV/AIDS, SARS, the 2009 swine flu pandemic, MERS, Ebola
and COVID-19.[13]

He played a significant role in the early 2000s in creating the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief[14] and in driving
development of biodefense drugs and vaccines following the 9/11
terrorist attacks.[15]

Fauci has been a visiting professor at many medical centers, and has received 30 honorary doctorates from
universities in the U.S. and abroad.[16]

Center Survey of the American Rheumatism Association, membership ranked Fauci's work on the treatment of
polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis as one of the most important advances in patient
management in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.[17][18]
Fauci has contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the
body's defenses leading to the progression to AIDS. He has outlined
the mechanisms of induction of HIV expression by endogenous
cytokines.[18] Fauci has worked to develop strategies for the therapy
and immune reconstitution of patients with the disease, as well as for a
vaccine to prevent HIV infection. His current research is concentrated
on identifying the nature of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of
HIV infection and the scope of the body's immune responses to HIV.

In 2003, the Institute for Scientific Information stated that from 1983
Fauci in June 2014
to 2002, "Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 to 3
million authors in all disciplines throughout the world who published
articles in scientific journals.”[5] As a government scientist under six
presidents, Fauci has been described as "a consistent spokesperson for science, a person who more than any
other figure has brokered a generational peace" between the two worlds of science and politics.[10]

HIV/AIDS epidemic
Fauci was one of the leading researchers during the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s.[19] In 1981, he heard
of the virus, and he and his team of researchers began looking for a vaccine or treatment for this novel virus,
though they would meet a number of obstacles.[20] In October 1988, protesters came to the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute's director in 1984, bore the brunt of
the anger from the LGBTQ community, who were largely ignored by the government.[1][21]
Leading AIDS activist Larry Kramer attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media.[22] He called him an
"incompetent idiot" and a "pill-pushing" tool of the medical establishment. Fauci did not have control over
drug approval though many people felt he was not doing enough. Fauci did make an effort in the late 1980s to
reach out to the gay community in New York and San Francisco to find ways he and the NIAID could find a
solution.[1] Though Fauci was initially admonished for his treatment of the AIDS epidemic, Fauci's work in
the community was eventually acknowledged; Kramer, who had spent years hating Fauci for his treatment of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic, eventually called him "the only true and great hero" among government officials in
the AIDS crisis.[1]

Ebola Congressional hearing
On October 16, 2014, in a United States Congressional hearing regarding the Ebola virus crisis, Fauci, who,
as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) had been discussing the
importance of screening for weeks,[23] testified that NIAID was still some distance away from producing
sufficient quantities of cures or vaccines for widespread trials.[24] Specifically, Fauci said, "While NIAID is an
active participant in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, it is
important to recognize that we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus
can be treated and prevented."[24]
Fauci also remarked in the hearing: "As we continue to expedite research while enforcing high safety and
efficacy standards, the implementation of the public health measures already known to contain prior Ebola
virus outbreaks and the implementation of treatment strategies such as fluid and electrolyte replacement are
essential to preventing additional infections, treating those already infected, protecting healthcare providers,
and ultimately bringing this epidemic to an end."[24]

Coronavirus Task Force
Fauci is a member of the White House Coronavirus Task
Force established in late January 2020, under President
Trump, to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.[25][26] He
became a "de facto" public health spokesperson for the
office of the president during the pandemic[27][28] and a
strong advocate for ongoing social distancing efforts in the
United States.[29]
In March, he predicted that the infection fatality rate would
likely be close to 1%, which was ten times more severe
than the 0.1% reported rate for seasonal flu.[30][31] On
March 29, 2020, Fauci argued for the extension of the
initial 15-day self-isolation guidelines, issued by the
executive office, to at least until the end of April 2020.[29]
In mid-April, Fauci stated that if the administration had

Pence (right)

"started mitigation earlier," more lives could have been saved, and "no one is going to deny that." He added
that the decision-making for implementing mitigation measures was "complicated,” and "there was a lot of
pushback about shutting things down back then."[32]
Fauci's comments were met with a hostile response from former Republican congressional candidate DeAnna
Lorraine. President Trump retweeted Lorraine's response, which included the call to "#FireFauci", drawing
public alarm. "Fire Fauci" has also been chanted loudly by anti-lockdown protesters in various locations,
including Florida and Texas.[33] As a result, the White House denied that Trump was firing Fauci, and blamed
the media for overreacting.[34][35]
Due to his disagreements with Trump, Fauci has been criticised by right-wing pundits and received death
threats that resulted in the need for a security detail.[36][37][38] In an interview with 60 Minutes he mentioned
that other members of his family, including his wife and daughters, have been repeatedly harassed since the
pandemic begun.[39]
On July 6, 2020, Fauci spoke on a Facebook livestream, offering his opinion that the country's situation as
pertaining to COVID-19 "is really not good,” pointing to more than 55,000 new cases on July 4, 2020. The
United States was "still knee-deep in the first wave" of cases, and was experiencing a "resurgence of
infections,” stated Fauci.[40] On July 7, 2020, during a press conference, Fauci stated that it was a "false
narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death" for COVID-19 in the country: "There's so many other things
that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency.” Both Trump and
the White House had cited the falling death rate as proof of success of the Trump administration's response.[41]
After this appearance by Fauci, the White House cancelled three scheduled media appearances by Fauci due
later that week.[42] On July 7, 2020, Trump contradicted Fauci's comments describing a dire situation in the
country, with Trump saying: "I think we are in a good place. I disagree with [Fauci]."[43] While there have
been disagreements, Trump has also praised Fauci.[44][45][46]
On July 9, 2020, Trump publicly claimed that Fauci "made a lot of mistakes.”[42][47][48] By July 12, 2020, a
White House official told media outlets that "several White House officials are concerned about the number of
times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things,” passing to the media on a list of purported mistakes made by Fauci
during the outbreak.[42][47] One of the supposed mistakes highlighted was Fauci's February 29, 2020,
statement in an interview that "at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a dayby-day basis.” However, the White House list neglected to mention that in that same interview, Fauci had
stated that the risk could change, "when you start to see community spread,” and that the disease could morph
into "a major outbreak" in the country.[49]
As late as September 23, 2020, when U.S. coronavirus fatalities exceeded 200,000, conservatives continued to
question Fauci's and the CDC's recommendations for responding to the epidemic. In a hearing before the
Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee,[50] Kentucky's Senator Rand Paul asked him if
he had "second thoughts" about his mitigation recommendations, including six feet apart of social distancing
and mask wearing, claiming, "our death rate is essentially worse than Sweden's." Fauci stood by the
guidelines, indicating Sweden's fatality rate exceeded those of other Scandinavian countries and said the
comparison between Sweden and the U.S. was not legitimate. Fauci said the recommendations remained valid.
After Paul then asserted New York's high fatality rate showed that mitigation efforts were insufficient, Fauci
replied, "You've misconstrued that Senator, and you've done that repetitively in the past." The doctor explained
further that New York State had succeeded in getting the virus under control by following the CDC's clinical
guidelines.[51] Paul had made numerous claims about herd immunity, Sweden's interventions to combat the
pandemic, the contention that the populations of Asian countries have greater resilience against COVID-19,
and death rates due to the virus.[50]

In October 2020, Fauci objected after his words "I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more" were
featured in an advertisement from the Trump campaign touting Trump's handling of the pandemic. Fauci said
he did not consent to the ad, his words were taken out of context (he was actually referring to how hard the
Coronavirus Task Force was working),[52] and he had never made a political endorsement in his career.[53]
On October 18, 2020 Fauci mentioned that he "wasn't surprised" Donald Trump contracted coronavirus.[39]
The next day, during a presidential call, Trump called Fauci "a disaster" and said that "people are tired of
COVID."[54] During a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona on October 19, Trump launched attacks on his
political rival Joe Biden where he said that Biden "wants to listen to Dr. Fauci" in reference to the COVID-19
pandemic response, upon which Biden merely replied "...yes" on Twitter.[55] On October 31, the Washington
Post published an extensive interview of Fauci, in which he voiced a candid assessment of the administration's
coronavirus policies and was critical of the influence of presidential advisor Scott Atlas.[56]
On December 2, the United Kingdom became the first western country to license a vaccine against the
coronavirus (Pfizer-BioNTech). In response, Fauci said that the FDA was proceeding "the correct way"[57]
and said the U.K. "really rushed through that approval".[58] The next day Fauci apologized, telling the BBC "I
have a great deal of confidence in what the U.K. does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint. Our
process is one that takes more time than it takes in the U.K. ... I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even
though it came out that way."[59]

Cultural impact
Owing to his prominent role in the United States response to numerous global pandemics, most notably
HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, Fauci has become the subject of tributes and interpretations across various media,
including television, literature, merchandising, and internet memes.[60][61] Brad Pitt's performance as Fauci
during the 2020 season of Saturday Night Live earned the actor an Emmy nomination, and praise from
Fauci.[62] Author Sally Quinn has credited Fauci as the inspiration for the love interest to the protagonist in her
bestselling 1991 romance novel Happy Endings.[63] Larry Kramer based the character Dr. Anthony Della
Vida on Fauci in his play The Destiny of Me.[64]

Personal life
In 1985, Fauci married Christine Grady, a nurse and bioethicist with the NIH, after they met while treating a
patient.[65] Grady is chief of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
Center.[41] The couple have three adult daughters.[66]

Memberships
Fauci is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the
National Academy of Medicine; the American Philosophical Society, and the Royal Danish Academy of
Sciences and Letters, as well as other numerous professional societies including the American Society for
Clinical Investigation, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Association of
Immunologists. He serves on the editorial boards of many scientific journals, as an editor of Harrison's
Principles of Internal Medicine, and as author, coauthor, or editor of more than 1,000 scientific publications,
including several textbooks.[16]
