Coronavirus disease 2019
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019. It has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing
difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to
the virus. Around one in five infected individuals do not develop any symptoms.[9] While most
people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms,[10] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood
clots. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed.
There is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute
phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for
months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues,
low-grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.[11][12][13][14]
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact[a]
with another person.[18][19] Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an
infected person's nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people
are infected if the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes. The virus may also spread via
fomites (contaminated surfaces) although this is not thought to be the main route of
transmission.[19] The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively,[20] but infection
mainly happens when people are near each other for long enough. It can spread as early as two
days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic
individuals. People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in
severe cases. Various testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The
standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
Preventive measures include social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces,
covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.
The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the
risk of transmissions. There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none has
completed clinical trials.
Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is
currently symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care,
isolation, and experimental measures.

Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe
illness.[22][23] Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties,
and loss of smell and taste. People with the same infection may have different symptoms,
and their symptoms may change over time. For example, one person may have a high
fever, a cough, and fatigue, and another person may have a low fever at the start of the
disease and develop difficulty breathing a week later. However, in people without prior
ears, nose, and throat (ENT) disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is
associated with COVID-19 with a specificity of 95%.[24]
[21]

Symptoms of COVID-19
As is common with infections, there is a delay, known as the incubation period, between
the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms.
The median incubation period for COVID-19 is four to five days.[25] Most symptomatic
people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic people will experience one or more
symptoms before day twelve.[25][26]

Around one in five people are infected with the virus but do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[27][28][29] These
asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and they can spread the disease.[30][31][29] Other infected people will develop symptoms later
(called pre-symptomatic) or have very mild symptoms, and can also spread the virus.[32]

Cause
COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus strain.

Transmission
COVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or
breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get
into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person.[33][34] During human-to-human
transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.
The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19. Closer distances can involve larger
droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer distances only involve aerosols. The larger droplets may also evaporate into
the aerosols (known as droplet nuclei). The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020,
however the virus is not known to transmit between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts. Airborne transmission is able to
particularly occur indoors, in high risk locations, such as in restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when
they are crowded or less ventilated. It also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on
COVID-19 patients.
Social distancing and the wearing of cloth face masks, surgical masks, respirators, or other face coverings are controls for droplet
transmission. Transmission may be decreased indoors with well maintained heating and ventilation systems to maintain good air circulation
and increase the use of outdoor air.[34]
The number of people generally infected by one infected person varies; as of September 2020 it was estimated that one infected person will,
on average, infect between two and three other people.[35] This is more infectious than influenza, but less so than measles.[36] It often
spreads in clusters, where infections can be traced back to an index case or geographical location. There is a major role of "super-spreading
events", where many people are infected by one person.

Virology
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the
cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[37] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus
occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[38]
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective
bubble.[39]
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[40] It is thought to have an animal
Illustration of SARSr-CoV virion
(zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the
genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov
RaTG13).[41][42] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein
(N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2%
homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with
the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3transmembrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET.[43]

Pathophysiology
COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[44] The
lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[45] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike"
(peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[46] The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in
that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[47] though another view is that increasing ACE2 using
angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[48] As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and
death may follow.[49]
Whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to invade the nervous system remains unknown. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of
COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of patients who died
from COVID-19, but these results need to be confirmed.[50] SARS-CoV-2 may cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as
other coronaviruses have been found to invade the CNS. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact
mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2
in the brain.[51][52][53] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS,
possibly within an infected white blood cell by a "Trojan horse" mechanism.[50]
The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal
epithelium[54] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[55]

The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[56] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12%
of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[57] and is more frequent in severe disease.[58] Rates of cardiovascular
symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute
myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[56] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are
involved in heart function.[56][59] A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found in intensive care unit
(ICU)-transferred patients with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[60] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation
(as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms,
and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection
appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has
also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[61]
Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[61] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both
in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[62]
Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory
infiltrates within the lung.[63]

Immunopathology
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have
symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), Macrophage
inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an
underlying immunopathology.[57]
Additionally, people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.[64]
Systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. In
particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes
and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.[65] Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[63]

Diagnosis
COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions.[67][68] Along with
laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high
clinical suspicion of infection.[69] Detection of prior infection is possible with serological tests,
which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.[70]

Viral testing
The standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR),[71] which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[72]
As this test detects RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of
patients is limited."[73] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a
nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[74][75] Results
are generally available within a few hours to two days.[76][77] Blood tests can be used, but these
require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.[78]
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[79]

Demonstration of a nasopharyngeal
swab for COVID-19 testing

A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies
produced by the body in response to infection.[70] Several have been evaluated by Public Health
England and approved for use in the UK.[80]
On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new
"spit test" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them
spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48
hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs and could enable people to conduct it at
home.[81]

The University of Oxford's CEBM has pointed to mounting evidence[82][83] that "a good
proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply
clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with" and have called for "an international effort to

standardize and periodically calibrate testing"[84] On 7 September, the UK government issued "guidance for procedures to be implemented
in laboratories to provide assurance of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the
predictive value of positive test results."[85]
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could
independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.[86][87][88] As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests
(which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely
used.[89][90][91] Antibody tests may be most accurate 2–3 weeks after a person's symptoms start.[92] The Chinese experience with testing
has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.[93] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first point-of-care test on 21
March 2020 for use at the end of that month.[94] The absence or presence of COVID-19 signs and symptoms alone is not reliable enough
for an accurate diagnosis.[95] Different clinical scores were created based on symptoms, laboratory parameters and imaging to determine
patients with probable SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe stages of COVID-19.[96][97]
A study asked hospitalised COVID-19 patients to cough into a sterile container, thus producing a saliva sample, and detected the virus in
eleven of twelve patients using RT-PCR. This technique has the potential of being quicker than a swab and involving less risk to health care
workers (collection at home or in the car).[98]
In November 2020, research showed that breath analysis could make the "rapid identification" in seconds for coronavirus possible.[99]

Imaging
Chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion
of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[69][100] Bilateral multilobar groundglass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early
infection.[69][101] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable
alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.[69][102] Characteristic
imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are
symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[103]
Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological
Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed
cases.[104] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation
by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[103] A large study in China
compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the
infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[68]

Coding
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2
for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.[105]

Pathology
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:[63]
Macroscopy: pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Lung findings:
minor serous exudation, minor fibrin exudation
pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic
infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation

diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates. DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
plasmocytosis in BAL[106]
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC);[107] leukoerythroblastic reaction[108]
Liver: microvesicular steatosis

Prevention
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home,
wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others,
ventilating indoor spaces, washing hands with soap and water often and for at
least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the
eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[110][111][112][113][114] Those
diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by
the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a
healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's
office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and
sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing
personal household items.[115][116]
The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by
the UK medicines regulator MHRA.[117] It is under evaluation for emergency use
authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries.[118]
The US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any
medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARSCoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[119][120] Without a vaccine,
other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing
COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as
"flattening the curve".[121] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease
the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of
current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine
become available.[121][122]

Prevention (CDC), describing how to stop the spread of
germs

Vaccine
A COVID‑19 vaccine is any of several different vaccine technologies intended to
provide acquired immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).[123]
Previous work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and
MERS established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses,
which accelerated development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms
for a COVID‑19 vaccine.[124]
As of mid-December 2020, 57 vaccine candidates were in clinical research:
namely, 40 in Phase I–II trials and 17 in Phase II–III trials.[125][126][127][128] No
vaccine candidate had fully completed a Phase III trial or obtained licensure, as of
December.[129]

Without pandemic containment measures—such as
social distancing, vaccination, and use of face masks—
pathogens can spread exponentially.[109] This graphic
shows how early adoption of containment measures
tends to protect wider swaths of the population.

In November 2020, Pfizer Inc and BioNTech,[130] Moderna,[131] the University
of Oxford (in collaboration with AstraZeneca),[132][133] and the Gamaleya
Institute[134] announced positive results from interim analyses of their Phase III
vaccine trials. Bahrain gave emergency marketing authorization for the vaccine
manufactured by Sinopharm,[135] followed by the United Arab Emirates.[136] In
December, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada, the United States and Mexico approved the Pfizer vaccine for emergency
use.[135][137][138][139][140][141] [142]

Social distancing
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by
minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces,
stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding

crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing
themselves from others.[143] Many governments are now mandating or
recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has
contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[144]
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government
bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people
(if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people,
and later to 10. A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with
other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but
the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local
conditions vary.[143]
Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as
diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and
compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and
complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as
much as possible in areas of community outbreak.

In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to
clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term
"social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in
contact through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations
to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.[145][146]

Self-isolation
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health
agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.
Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have
been issued to those in high-risk groups.[147] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently
travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last
possible exposure.

Face masks and respiratory hygiene
The WHO and US CDC recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of
transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[148][149] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of
the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social
distancing.[149][150] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and
coughing.[149][150] Face coverings also filter out viral particles from inhaled air, reducing the chance that the wearer will become
infected.[151] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the
public to limit the spread of the virus.[152][153]
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the
disease.[154] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and
recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare
professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or
equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.[155]

Hand-washing and hygiene
When not wearing a mask, the CDC, WHO, and NHS recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing
and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[111][156][157] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is
encouraged.[111][156] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially
after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.[157] The CDC recommends using an
alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.[156] For areas where
commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the
antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is
"not an active substance for hand antisepsis". Glycerol is added as a humectant.[158]

Surface cleaning
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface),
including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5
percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. Ultraviolet
germicidal irradiation may also be used.[159] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as
an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards,
remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[160]

Ventilation and air filtration
The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.[161][159][162]

Healthy diet and lifestyle
The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recommends that COVID-19 has made the maintenance of one's immune system more
important than ever. Therefore, eating a healthy diet, being physically active, managing psychological stress, and getting enough sleep are
critical.[163] Dark-skinned people are at particular risk of a vitamin D deficiency which can impair the immune system.[164]

Treatment
The management of COVID-19 includes supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected
vital organs.[165][166][167] The WHO is in the process of including dexamethasone in guidelines for treatment for hospitalized patients, and it
is recommended for consideration in Australian guidelines for patients requiring oxygen.[168][169] CDC recommends those who suspect
they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.[170] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of
respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[171][172] Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been
recommended to improve immunity.[173] Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of
infection.[174] Nasal breathing is suggested as such a procedure based on several peer reviewed studies.[175][176]
The WHO, the Chinese National Health Commission, and the United States' National Institutes of Health have published recommendations
for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID‑19.[177][178][179] Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled
treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.[180][181]

Medications
Remdesivir
As of late October 2020, Remdesivir was the only drug approved by the FDA with a specific indication to treat COVID-19.[182][183] In
Australia and the European Union, remdesivir (Veklury) is indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged twelve
years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.[184][185][186][187]
Late November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) made a conditional recommendation against treatment with remdesivir for
hospitalized patients, regardless of severity (based on data from the Solidarity Trial).[188]
On 1 May 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the drug an emergency use authorization (EUA) for people
hospitalized with severe COVID-19.[189] On 28 August 2020, the FDA broadened the EUA for remdesivir to include all hospitalized
patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of the severity of their disease.[190] Remdesivir was approved for
medical use in the United States in October 2020.[191][192] It is the first treatment for COVID-19 to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).[192] It is indicated for use in adults and adolescents aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40
kilograms (88 lb) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.[192]
Baricitinib
In November 2020 the FDA granted Emergency use authorization (EUA)[b] for the drug baricitinib to be given to certain patients
hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, but only in conjunction with remdesivir.[193] In a single clinical trial, this combination
therapy was shown to have a small, but statistically significant effect on patient outcomes compared to administration of remdesivir
alone.[194] Use of baricitinib was restricted to adults and children two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical
ventilation, or ECMO.[193]
Dexamethasone

In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents (from twelve
years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.[195]

Prognosis
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course
with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory
diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically recover within
two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to
six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from
symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[41] The
Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between
the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being
spent hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median
time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.[202] Prolonged
prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to
the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a
transfer to ICU.[203][204]
Some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with COVID-19 will
experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[205][206] A majority
of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report longterm problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[207] On 30
October 2020 WHO chief Tedros Adhanom has warned that "to a
significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious
long-term effects". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19
symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning." They range
from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury
of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological
and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any
system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of
fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and
other symptoms. Tedros has underlined that therefore herd immunity is
"morally unconscionable and unfeasible".[208]
In terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to
return for hospital treatment within 2 months of discharge. The average
to readmit was 8 days since first hospital visit.There are several risk
factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions
to a hospital facility. Among these are advanced age (above 65 years of
age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, COPD, heart
failure or chronic kidney disease.[209][210]
According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require
intensive care or die compared to non-smokers,[211][212] air pollution is
similarly associated with risk factors,[212] and pre-existing heart and lung
diseases[213] and also obesity contributes to an increased health risk of
COVID-19.[212][214][215]

Italy, as of 3 June 2020[200]

It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher
risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.[216] One research that
looked into the COVID-19 infections in hospitalized kidney transplant
recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.[217]
Children make up a small proportion of reported cases, with about 1% of
cases being under 10 years and 4% aged 10–19 years.[218] They are
likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease
than adults.
A European multinational study of hospitalized children published in
The Lancet on 25 June 2020 found that about 8% of children admitted to
a hospital needed intensive care. Four of those 582 children (0.7%) died,
but the actual mortality rate could be "substantially lower" since milder
cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.[219]

The number of deaths vs total cases by country and approximate
case fatality rate[201]

Mortality rates are highly correlated to age. In those younger than 50 years the risk of death is less than 0.5%, while in those older than 70 it
is more than 8%.[220][221][222] According to a CDC analysis, the risk of death by age groups in the United States is 0.003%, 0.02%; 0.5%
and 5.4% for the age groups 0–19, 20–49, 50–69, and 70 or over, respectively.[223][224]
Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I
interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID-19.[225][226] Genetic screening is able to detect
interferon effector genes.[227]
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, like severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but data for COVID-19 is lacking.[228][229]

Comorbidities
Most of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
cardiovascular disease.[276] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.[277] The
Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one
comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases.[202] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension
(66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic
renal failure (20.2% of deaths).
Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the CDC, are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic
fibrosis.[278] Evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with
worse patient outcomes.[279][280] When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID-19, they might be at greater
risk for severe symptoms.[281] COVID-19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their
drug use may have caused lung damage.[282]
In August 2020 the CDC issued caution that tuberculosis infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO
recommended that patients with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID-19 couldn't rule out coinfections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional TB cases
and 1.4 million TB related deaths by 2025.[283]

Complications
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and
death.[86][284][285][286][287]
Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.[288]
Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury.[120][289]
Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor
functions).[290][291] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms
similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[292][293] In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in
those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have an altered mental status.[294]

Longer-term effects
Some early studies[205][295] suggest between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a
month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of
breath.[207]
On 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros has warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious
long-term effects". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning." They range
from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also
neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical
bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms. Tedros has underlined that therefore herd
immunity is “morally unconscionable and unfeasible”.[296]

Immunity
The immune response by humans to CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production,[297] just
as with most other infections.[298] However, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the
disease.[299][300] Cases in which recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
In some of these cases, the RNA from the first and second infections indicates a different strain of the virus.[301][302][303][304] Some
reinfection cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection,[304] or false positives due to remaining, non-infectious RNA
fragments.[305] Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.[306]

History
The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin,[38] through spillover infection.[307] The first known human infections were in
Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest
date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.[308][309][310] Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms
as 8 December 2019.[311] Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January
2020.[312][313] According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold
live animals.[314] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples
collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event,
but it was not the site of the initial outbreak.[315] Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin,
Italy, on 18 December 2019.[316]
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[317] According to an unpublicised report from the
Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.
There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were "patient zero". By December 2019, the
spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[197][318] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei
gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[319] and at least 266 by 31 December.[320] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital
sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28
December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new
coronavirus.[321] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei
Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[322] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan
Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan
Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health
Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[323] Eight of these doctors,
including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[324] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen,
was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[325]
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31
December, confirming 27 cases[326][327][328]—enough to trigger an investigation.[329]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[330] In early and midJanuary 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and
major rail interchange.[41] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in
Shenzhen.[331] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[332] and more may have been
infected.[333] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for
health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[57][334] On 30 January, the WHO declared the
coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[333] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[335]
On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[336] As of 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization
(WHO) considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[337] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most
deaths.[338] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[339]
Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than
directly from China or any other Asian country.[340] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December
2019[341][342] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[343]
On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case,[344] Beijing reported the first COVID-19 case, followed by two more
cases on 12 June.[345] By 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed.[346] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale
Market.[344][347]

Possible earlier cases
Research in Italy on samples from 959 volunteers in an experimental lung cancer treatment undertaken from September 2019 have shown
COVID-19 anti-bodies in 14% of the samples. National Cancer Institute in Milan director Giovanni Apolone suggests that the major
outbreak in Italy could have been caused because COVID-19 was wide spread in Italy from Summer 2019.[348]

Epidemiology
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[349] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the
volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex,
and overall health.[350]

The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns
Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.2% (1,597,843/71,226,341) as of 12 December 2020.[8] The number varies
by region.[351]
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the
infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Many academics have attempted
to calculate these numbers for specific populations.[352]
Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[353][354] In the United States, the
prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and
lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.[353]

Infection fatality rate
Infection fatality rate or infection fatality ratio (IFR) is distinguished from case fatality rate (CFR). The CFR for a disease is the proportion of
deaths from the disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease (within a certain period of time). The IFR, in
contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the infected individuals. IFR, unlike CFR, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and
undiagnosed infections.
In February, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.[357][358] On 2 July, The WHO's Chief
Scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.[359][360] In August, the WHO
found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.[361]
The CDC provides estimates for public health planning purposes, including the following IFR ranges by age.[362]

Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot
be less than the population fatality rate. As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758
confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.3% of the population).[363] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an
IFR of ~0.9%,[364] and ~1.4%.[365] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died.[366]

Sex differences
Early reviews of epidemiologic data showed greater impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and
Italy.[1][367][368] The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for
women.[369] Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between
genders.[370][371] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle
choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[372] Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of
smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to
the higher mortality in men.[373] In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.[374]
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.[375] Research has shown that viral illnesses
like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.[375]

Ethnic differences
In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.[377]
Structural factors that prevent them from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in
"essential" occupations such as such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. Greater
prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease also increase
their risk of death.[378] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.[377] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34%
of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly
adults.[379] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as
living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[380] Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[381]
In the U.K., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority
background.[382][383][384]

Name
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan
coronavirus",[385][386][387] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[388][389] In the past, many diseases have been named
after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[390] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.[391]
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCov[392] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[393] as interim
names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China),
animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[394][395][396]
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[397] WHO chief Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December
2019).[398] The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[397]

Misinformation
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other
aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.[399][400][401]

Other animals
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. A
domestic cat in Liège, Belgium, tested positive after it started showing symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting, shortness of breath) a week later than
its owner, who was also positive.[402] Tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York, United States, tested positive for the virus and
showed symptoms of COVID-19, including a dry cough and loss of appetite.[403] Minks at two farms in the Netherlands also tested positive
for COVID-19.[404] In Denmark, as of October 31, 2020, 175 mink farms had seen COVID-19 infection in mink, and also USA; Finland,
Sweden and Spain have seen infections in mink.[405][406]
A study on domesticated animals inoculated with the virus found that cats and ferrets appear to be "highly susceptible" to the disease, while
dogs appear to be less susceptible, with lower levels of viral replication. The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks,
and chickens.[407]
As of August 2020, dozens of domestic cats and dogs had tested positive, though according to the U.S. CDC, there was no evidence they
transmitted the virus to humans.[408] CDC guidance recommends potentially infected people avoid close contact with pets.[408]
On 4 November 2020, Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen stated that a mutated coronavirus was being transmitted to humans via
minks, tied primarily to mink farms in Northern Jutland.[409]

Research
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry
researchers.[410][411] There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts
to meet the global demand.[412]
As of December 2020, hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except Antarctica.[413]
As of November 2020, more than 200 possible treatments had been studied in humans so far.[414]

Transmission and prevention research

Modelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission,[415] diagnosis and
prognosis of infection,[416] estimation of the impact of interventions,[417][418] or allocation of resources.[419] Modelling studies are mostly
based on epidemiological models,[420] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of
models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of
COVID-19,[421] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure,[422] mobility-data based models to investigate
transmission,[423] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.[424] Further, conceptual frameworks
from crisis management research have been applied to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on organizations worldwide.[425][426]

Treatment-related research
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID-19 treatments.[427][428] Other candidates in trials include
vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.[428]
In March 2020, the World Health Organization initiated the Solidarity Trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: an
experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and
interferon-beta.[429][430] More than 300 active clinical trials were underway as of April 2020.[120]
Research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that it was ineffective at best,[431][432] and that it may
reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.[433] By May 2020, France, Italy and Belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a
COVID-19 treatment.[434]
In June, initial results from a randomised trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for patients
who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[435] Because this is a well tested and widely
available treatment this was welcomed by the WHO that is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other
steroids.[436][437] Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health
for patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID-19 who
do not require supplemental oxygen.[438]
In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.[439] The WHO recommends systemic
corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID-19 (strong
recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).[439] The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with
non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).[439] The updated guidance was based on a metaanalysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 patients.[440][441]
In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve
years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.[195] Dexamethasone can be taken by
mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.[195]
In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational
monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19.[442] Bamlanivimab is authorized for people
with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), and
who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization.[442] This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or
who have certain chronic medical conditions.[442]
Cytokine storm
A cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19. A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction
where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly; A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and
multiple organ failure.[443] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses
to COVID-19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses;
These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.[444]
Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.[445][446]
It is undergoing a Phase II non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe
disease.[447][448] Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be
confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some
affected people.[449] The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to undergo a
Phase III clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID-19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory
cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.[450] To date, there is no randomised, controlled
evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS. Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by
saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood-brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of
CRS.[451]
Lenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a
viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T-cells in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.[452]

The Feinstein Institute of Northwell Health announced in March a study on "a human antibody that may prevent the activity" of IL-6.[453]
Passive antibodies
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people
who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.[454][455] Viral neutralization is the anticipated
mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is
the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.[456] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARSCoV-2 have entered clinical studies.[457] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID-19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections.[456] Other mechanisms,
however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.[454] Other forms of passive antibody
therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.[454]
The use of passive antibodies to treat people with active COVID-19 is also being studied. This involves the production of convalescent
serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then
administered to current patients.[454] This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.[454] A Cochrane review in October 2020
found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against this treatment in COVID-19, due in large part to the methodology of the clinical
trials conducted so far.[455] Specifically, there are no trials yet conducted for which the safety of convalescent serum administration to people
with COVID-19 can be determined, and the differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.[455]
Laminoid antibodies
Research using alpacas and llamas in Peru may produce a treatment for COVID-19. Alpacas and other laminoid animals (South American
camel-like animals) naturally produce a very small type of antibody known as nanobodies.[458][459][460]
