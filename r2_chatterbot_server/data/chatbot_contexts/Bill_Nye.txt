Bill Nye
William Sanford Nye (born November 27, 1955),[3] popularly
known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, is an American science
communicator, television presenter, and mechanical engineer. He is
best known as the host of the PBS and syndicated children's science
show Bill Nye the Science Guy (1993–1998), the Netflix show Bill
Nye Saves the World (2017–2018), and for his many subsequent
appearances in popular media as a science educator.
Born in Washington, D.C., Nye began his career as a mechanical
engineer for Boeing Corporation in Seattle, where he invented a
hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used on 747 airplanes. In 1986,
Nye left Boeing to pursue comedy, writing and performing jokes and
bits for the local sketch television show Almost Live!, where he
regularly conducted wacky science experiments. Nye aspired to
become the next Mr. Wizard, and with the help of several producers,
successfully pitched the children's television program Bill Nye the
Science Guy to KCTS-TV, Seattle's public television station. The
show—which proudly proclaimed in its theme song that "science
rules!"—ran from 1993 to 1998 in national TV syndication. Known
for its "high-energy presentation and MTV-paced segments,"[4] the
program became a hit among kids and adults, was critically acclaimed
and was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards, winning 19, including
Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming for Nye himself.
Following the success of his show, Nye continued to advocate for
science, becoming the CEO of the Planetary Society and helping
develop sundials for the Mars Exploration Rover missions.[5] He has
written two bestselling books on science: Undeniable: Evolution and
the Science of Creation (2014) and Unstoppable: Harnessing Science
to Change the World (2015). He has appeared frequently on other TV
shows, including Dancing with the Stars, The Big Bang Theory, and
Inside Amy Schumer.[6] He starred in a documentary about his life
and science advocacy, Bill Nye: Science Guy, which premiered at the
South by Southwest Film Festival in March 2017; and, in October
2017, was named a NYT Critic's Pick.[1] In 2017, he debuted the
Netflix series Bill Nye Saves the World.

Early life
Nye was born November 27, 1955,[7][8] in Washington, D.C., to Jacqueline
Jenkins-Nye (née Jenkins; 1921–2000), who was a codebreaker during World
War II; and Edwin Darby "Ned" Nye (1917–1997), who also served in World
War II and worked as a contractor building an airstrip on Wake Island.[9] Ned
was captured and spent four years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp; living
without electricity or watches, he learned how to tell time using the shadow of
a shovel handle, spurring his passion for sundials.[9][10][11][12] Jenkins-Nye
was among a small elite group of young women known as "Goucher Girls,"
alumnae of Goucher College in Towson, Maryland, whom the Navy enlisted
to help crack codes used by Japan and Germany. "She wasn't Rosie the
Riveter, she was Rosie the Top-Secret Code Breaker," Nye recalls. "People
would ask her what she did during World War II and she'd say, 'I can't talk
about it, ha ha ha!' "[13]

Nye as a senior in high
school

Nye attended Lafayette Elementary School and Alice Deal Junior High
before attending Sidwell Friends for high school on a scholarship, graduating
in 1973.[14][15] He moved to Ithaca, New York to attend Cornell University for college and study at the Sibley School of
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. His enthusiasm for science deepened after he took an astronomy
class with Carl Sagan.[16] He graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering in 1977.[17]

Early career in Seattle
1977–1986: Boeing
After graduating from Cornell, Nye worked as an engineer for the Boeing Corporation and Sundstrand Data
Control near Seattle. At Boeing, he invented a hydraulic resonance suppressor tube used on Boeing 747
airplanes.[18] He applied four times, unsuccessfully, for NASA's astronaut training program.[19]

Nye started doing standup comedy after winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest in 1978.[20] Nye's friends
asked him to do Steve Martin impressions at parties, and he discovered how much he enjoyed making people
laugh. He began moonlighting as a comedian while working at Boeing.[21] He has stated, "At this point in our
story, I was working on business jet navigation systems, laser gyroscope systems during the day, and I'd take a
nap and go do stand-up comedy by night."[21]
He also participated in Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, and volunteered at the Pacific Science Center on
weekends as a "Science Explainer."[20]

1986–1991: Comedy beginnings and Almost Live!
Nye quit his job at Boeing on October 3, 1986 to focus on his burgeoning comedy career.[21]
During Nye's 10-year college reunion in 1987, he went to great lengths to meet with Sagan at Cornell. Sagan's
assistant told Nye, "Okay, you can talk to him for five minutes." In their meeting at the space sciences
building, Nye explained that he was interested in developing a science television program. "I mentioned how I
planned to talk about bridges and bicycles and so on—stuff that, as an engineer, I'd been interested in—and
[Sagan] said, 'Focus on pure science. Kids resonate to pure science rather than technology.' And that turned
out to be great advice."[22]
In 1986, Nye worked as a writer/actor on a local sketch comedy television show in Seattle called Almost Live!.
He first got his big break on the show from John Keister who met him during an open mic night.[23] After a
guest canceled, cohost Ross Shafer told Nye he had seven minutes of programming to fill. "Why don't you do
that science stuff?" Shafer suggested.[24] Nye entertained audiences with comical demonstrations, including
what happened when you ate a marshmallow that had been dipped in liquid nitrogen.[25] His other main
recurring role on Almost Live! was as Speed Walker, a speedwalking Seattle superhero "who fights crime
while maintaining strict adherence to the regulations of the international speedwalking association."[20]
A famous incident on the show led to Nye's stage name. He corrected Keister on his pronunciation of the
word "gigawatt", and Keister responded, "Who do you think you are—Bill Nye the Science Guy?"[26] Nye's
science experiments resonated with viewers, and the local chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts
and Sciences awarded him a talent Emmy for one of his segments.[27]
Even though Nye was regular on Almost Live!, he was only doing freelance work for the program.[28] While
looking for more TV gigs, he got the opportunity in 1989 to host Fabulous Wetlands, a short educational show
about Washington's wetlands, sponsored by the Washington State Department of Ecology.[28] On Fabulous
Wetlands, Nye explained the importance of preserving estuaries, and the hazards of pollution.[29] The show
was, in many ways, a model for Nye's later show, with "zany camera cuts paired with Nye's humor" that set it
apart from other scientific broadcasts.[28] Nye soon got more offers to appear on nationally broadcast
programs, including eight segments of the Disney Channel's All-New Mickey Mouse Club.[27]
Following his stint on Almost Live!, from 1991 to 1993 Nye appeared on live-action educational segments of
Back to the Future: The Animated Series, assisting Dr. Emmett Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd).[30]

Bill Nye the Science Guy
In 1993, collaborating with James McKenna, Erren Gottlieb and Elizabeth Brock, Nye developed a pilot for a
new show, Bill Nye the Science Guy, for the Seattle public broadcasting station KCTS-TV.[31] They pitched
the show as "Mr. Wizard meets Pee-wee's Playhouse".[22] Nye obtained underwriting for the show from the
National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy. The program became part of a package of
syndicated series that local stations could schedule to fulfill Children's Television Act requirements.[32]

Because of this, Bill Nye the Science Guy became the first program to run
concurrently on public and commercial stations.[32] The series was
produced by Walt Disney Television and Rabbit Ears Productions, and
distributed by Disney.[33]
Bill Nye the Science Guy ran from 1993 to 1998, and was one of the mostwatched educational TV shows in the United States.[34] While portraying
"The Science Guy", Nye wore a powder blue lab coat and a bow tie. Nye
Labs, the production offices and set where the show was recorded, was in a
converted clothing warehouse near Seattle's Kingdome.[34] Although it
focused on younger viewers, it also attracted a significant adult audience.[35]
Its ability to make science entertaining and accessible made it a popular
teaching tool in classrooms. With its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV-style
pacing, the show won critical acclaim and was nominated for 23 Emmy
Awards, winning nineteen. Research studies found that regular viewers
were better at explaining scientific ideas than non-viewers.[36]
In addition to the TV show, Nye published several books as The Science
Guy. A CD-ROM based on the series, titled Bill Nye the Science Guy: Stop
the Rock!, was released in 1996 for Windows and Macintosh by Pacific
Interactive. [37][34]

Nye's Science Guy personality is also prominent at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts—most notably his
appearance with Ellen DeGeneres at Ellen's Energy Adventure, an attraction that ran from 1996 to 2017 at the
Universe of Energy pavilion at Epcot at Walt Disney World. Nye's Science Guy character is also heard in a
voice-over in the DINOSAUR attraction at Disney's Animal Kingdom,[38] and was the on-air spokesman for
the Noggin television network in 1999.[39]

Post–Science Guy work
The Eyes of Nye
Following the success of Bill Nye the Science Guy, Nye
began work on a comeback project, The Eyes of Nye,
aimed at an older audience and tackling more
controversial science topics such as genetically modified
food, global warming and race. However, "shifting
creative concepts, infighting among executives and
disputes over money with Seattle producing station
KCTS" significantly delayed production for years.[40]
KCTS was hampered by budgetary problems and
couldn't produce a show pilot on time.[40] "KCTS went

on April 22, 2017.
through some distress," Nye recalled. "When we did The
Eyes of Nye, the budget started out really big, and by the
time we served all these little problems at KCTS, we had
a much lower budget for the show than we'd ever had for the 'Science Guy' show which was made several
years earlier."[23] PBS declined to distribute Eyes of Nye, and it was eventually picked up by American Public
Television. "PBS wanted more serious, in-depth Nova-style shows," explained co-producer Randy

Brinson.[41] The show, which eventually premiered in 2005, lasted only one season. Nye acknowledged that
omitting his bow tie on the program was a mistake. "I tried wearing a straight tie. It was nothing," Nye said.
"We were trying something new. It wasn't me."[23]

Other media appearances
From 2000 to 2002, Nye was the technical expert on BattleBots.[42]
In 2004 and 2005, he hosted 100 Greatest Discoveries, an awardwinning series produced by THINKFilm for The Science Channel,
broadcast in high definition on the Discovery HD Theater
network.[43] In 2007, he also hosted an eight-part Discovery Channel
series, Greatest Inventions with Bill Nye.[44]
A lecture Nye gave on getting children excited about math inspired
the creation of the crime drama Numb3rs, where Nye appeared in
several episodes as an engineering professor.[45] On October 28,
2007, he also made guest appearances on the VH1 reality show
America's Most Smartest Model.[46]

Nye appeared on segments of Heidi Cullen's The Climate Code, later renamed Forecast Earth on The
Weather Channel, relating his personal ways of saving energy.[47] In the fall of 2008, he appeared periodically
on the daytime game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire as part of its "Ask the Expert" feature. [48]
In 2008, Nye hosted Stuff Happens, a short-lived show on the Planet Green network.[49] In November 2008,
he portrayed himself in the fifth-season episode "Brain Storm" of Stargate Atlantis, alongside fellow television
personality and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.[50]
In October 2009, Nye recorded a short YouTube video (as himself, not his TV persona) advocating cleanenergy climate-change legislation, on behalf of Al Gore's Repower America campaign.[51] He joined the
American Optometric Association in a multimedia advertising campaign to persuade parents to provide their
children with comprehensive eye examinations.[52]
In 2013, Nye guest starred in The Big Bang Theory episode "The Proton Displacement."[53] In the episode,
Sheldon Cooper befriends Nye and brings him in to teach Leonard Hofstadter a "lesson" after Professor
Proton (played by Bob Newhart) helps Leonard with an experiment instead of Sheldon. Professor Proton
accuses Bill Nye of making his TV series similar to Proton's show. After Nye and Sheldon leave, Leonard
receives a selfie of the two having smoothies, and later gets a text from Sheldon asking for a ride home, as Nye
has ditched him at the smoothie store. In a later discussion with Professor Proton, Sheldon reveals that Nye
had a restraining order against him, so he could not help him contact Nye.[54]
On February 28, 2014, Nye was a celebrity guest and interviewer at the White House Student Film
Festival.[55]
On August 31, 2016, Netflix announced that Nye would appear in a new series, Bill Nye Saves the World,
which premiered on April 21, 2017.[56][57] Nye appeared in the 2016 documentary Food Evolution, directed
by Academy Award-nominated director Scott Hamilton Kennedy and narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson.[58]
In 2017, he was the subject of a biographical documentary film, Bill Nye: Science Guy, directed by David
Alvarado and Jason Sussberg.[1] Nye was honorary co-chair of the inaugural March for Science on April 22,
2017.[59]

In 2018, Nye guest-starred in an episode of Blindspot, "Let It Go", playing a fictionalized version of himself
who is the father of the character Patterson.[60] Nye's fictional self also alludes to his rivalry with Rodney
McKay, which was established in the aforementioned "Brain Storm" episode of Stargate Atlantis.[61] Also in
2018, Nye made a second guest appearance on The Big Bang Theory as himself, together with fellow scientist
Neil deGrasse Tyson, in the first episode ("The Conjugal Configuration") of the show's final season.[62]
In September 2019, Nye was a guest on Episode 127 of Jonathan Van Ness's podcast Getting Curious, where
they discussed climate change, the failures of cold fusion, the potential of better battery technology for storage
of energy produced by wind turbines and solar panels, the benefits of and forthcoming improvements to
electric vehicles, and the detriment and failures of fossil fuel and nuclear energy, measures toward water
cleanliness, the role of girls' and women's education in improving the environment, and the threat the Trump
administration posed to the environment and to scientific thought in general.[63][64][65]
Nye will also voice himself in the upcoming animated feature Happy Halloween, Scooby Doo!.[66] Nye
portrayed Upton Sinclair in the 2020 biopic Mank.

Science advocacy

Nye orating in October 2010

In the early 2000s, Nye assisted in the development of a small sundial
included in the Mars Exploration Rover missions.[7] Known as
MarsDial, in addition to tracking time, it had small colored panels to
provide a basis for color calibration.[67] From 2005 to 2010, Nye was
the vice president of the Planetary Society, an organization that
advocates space science research and the exploration of other planets,
particularly Mars.[68] He became the organization's second Executive
Director in September 2010 when Louis Friedman stepped
down.[69][70]

In November 2010, Nye
became the face of a major science exhibition at the Chabot Space &
Science Center in Oakland, California.[71] Bill Nye's Climate Lab
featured him as commander of the Clean Energy Space Station and
invited visitors on an urgent mission to thwart climate change.[72]
From 2001 to 2006, Nye served as Frank H. T. Rhodes Class of '56
University Professor at Cornell University.[17][73]
On August 27, 2011, gave a public lecture at Cornell University that
filled its 715-seat Statler Auditorium.[74] He spoke of his father's
passion for sundials and timekeeping, his time at Cornell, his work on
the sundials on the Mars rovers, and the story behind the Bill Nye
Solar Noon Clock,[5] which he then presented to the university atop
Rhodes Hall.

Nye conducted a Q&A session after the 2012 Mars Rover Landing.[75]
Nye is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a U.S. nonprofit scientific and educational
organization that promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining
controversial and extraordinary claims.[76] Interviewed by John Rael for the Independent Investigation Group
IIG, Nye said that his "concern right now ... [is] scientific illiteracy ... you [the public] don't have enough
rudimentary knowledge of the universe to evaluate claims."[77] In November 2012, he launched a Kickstarter
campaign for an educational aerodynamics game called AERO 3D, but it was not funded.[78]

Nye speaking to a group
about Mars in June 2016

In September 2012, Nye claimed that
creationist views threatened science
education and innovation in the
United States.[79][80][81] In February
2014, he debated creationist Ken
Ham at the Creation Museum on
whether creation is a viable model of
origins in today's modern, scientific
era.[82][83][84] In July 2016, Ham
gave Nye a tour of the Ark
Encounter the day after it first opened
to the public.[85][86] He and Ham had
an informal debate while touring the
structure,[87] and footage from Nye's
visit was subsequently included in the
documentary film Bill Nye: Science
Guy, released in 2017.[88]

pocket protector during the Navy
Office of General Counsel Spring
2011 Conference.

Since 2013, Nye has been a member of the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science
Education.[89]
On Earth Day 2015, Nye met with U.S. President Obama to visit Everglades National Park in Florida and
discuss climate change and science education.[90][91][92]
In March 2015, Nye announced he changed his mind and now supported GMOs.[93] In a new edition of
Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation, Nye rewrote a chapter on GMOs reflecting his new
position.[94] In a radio interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson, he said, "There's no difference between allergies
among GMO eaters and non-GMO eaters... I've changed my mind about genetically modified organisms."[95]
In July 2017, Nye observed that the majority of climate change deniers are older people, and said, "So we're
just going to have to wait for those people to 'age out', as they say."[96] He has continued to advocate against
climate change. On Last Week Tonight with John Oliver on May 12, 2019, he discussed climate change and
the proposed Green New Deal, and said:[97]
Here, I've got an experiment for you—safety glasses on. By the end of this century, if emissions
keep rising, the average temperature on Earth could go up another 4 to 8 degrees. What I'm
saying is the planet's on fucking fire. There are a lot of things we could do to put it out. Are any
of them free? No, of course not—nothing's free, you idiots. Grow the fuck up. You're not children
anymore. I didn't mind explaining photosynthesis to you when you were 12, but you're adults
now and this is an actual crisis. Got it? Safety glasses off, motherfuckers.
— Bill Nye, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, May 12, 2019, Business Insider

Personal life
Nye has residences in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, in New York City,[106] and on Mercer
Island near Seattle.[107] His California house is solar-powered, and often feeds extra power back into the
public power grid, something he enjoys showing visitors.[108]
Nye and his neighbor, environmental activist/actor Ed Begley, Jr., have engaged in a friendly competition "to
see who could have the lowest carbon footprint", according to Begley.[109] Nye often appeared on Begley's
HGTV/Planet Green reality show Living with Ed.[110]
In July 2012, Nye supported President Barack Obama's reelection bid.[111] He frequently consulted with
Obama on science matters during Obama's presidency, and famously took a selfie with him and Neil deGrasse
Tyson at the White House.[112] Nye attended the 2018 State of the Union Address after being invited by
Oklahoma Congressman Jim Bridenstine. Nye's attendance drew scrutiny due to Bridestine's "history of
expressing climate change skepticism," but Nye defended him: "While the Congressman and I disagree on a

great many issues, we share a deep respect for NASA and its
achievements and a strong interest in the future of space exploration.
My attendance tomorrow should not be interpreted as an endorsement
of this administration, or of Congressman Bridenstine's nomination, or
seen as an acceptance of the recent attacks on science and the
scientific community."[113] Nye endorsed Jay Inslee during the 2020
Democratic primaries, until Inslee suspended his campaign on August
21, 2019.[114] On October 28, 2020, Nye took to Twitter endorsing
Joe Biden for president, urging his followers to vote on behalf of
climate change and science.[115]

Nye married musician Blair Tindall on February 3, 2006; however, he
annulled the relationship seven weeks later when the marriage license
was declared invalid.[116] In 2007, Nye obtained a restraining order
against Tindall after she broke into his house and stole several items,
including his laptop computer, which she used to send defamatory emails impersonating Nye, and damaged
Nye's garden with herbicide. Tindall acknowledged killing the plants but denied being a threat to Nye.[117]
Nye subsequently sued Tindall for $57,000 in attorney's fees after she allegedly violated the protective
order.[118]
In the 2017 PBS documentary Bill Nye: Science Guy, Nye revealed his family's plight of ataxia. Due to his
father's, sister's and brother's lifelong struggles with balance and coordination, Nye decided to not have
children to avoid the chance of passing on the condition, even though he "dodged the genetic bullet"
himself.[119]
In July 2018, Nye played for the National League squad at the MLB All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball
Game. After striking out in his first at-bat, he singled in the bottom of the third inning to a rousing ovation
from the Nationals Park crowd.
Nye is a member of two trade unions.[120]

Awards and honors
In May 1999, Nye was the commencement speaker at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where he was awarded
an honorary doctor of science degree.[121] He received honorary doctorates from Johns Hopkins University in
May 2008,[122] and in May 2011 from Willamette University[123] In May 2015, Rutgers University awarded
him an honorary doctor of science degree and paid him a $35,000 speaker's fee for presenting the ceremony's
keynote address.[124] Nye also received an honorary doctor of pedagogy degree during a commencement
ceremony at Lehigh University on May 20, 2013.[125] He received the 2010 Humanist of the Year Award
from the American Humanist Association.[126] In October 2015, Nye was awarded an honorary doctorate of
science from Simon Fraser University.[127] In 2011, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) gave Nye
their highest award, In Praise of Reason. On behalf of the committee, Eugenie Scott stated: "If you think Bill
is popular among skeptics, you should attend a science teacher conference where he is speaking—it is standing
room only... No one has more fun than Nye when he is demonstrating principles of science."[128] In 1997,
CSICOP also presented Nye with the Candle in the Dark Award for his "lively, creative... endeavor."[129]
