The Mandalorian
The Mandalorian is an American space Western
streaming television series created by Jon Favreau for
Disney+. It premiered with the service's launch in
November 2019, and is the first live-action series in the
Star Wars franchise. It begins five years after the events of
Return of the Jedi (1983) and stars Pedro Pascal as the title
character, a lone bounty hunter who is hired to retrieve
"The Child".
Star Wars creator George Lucas began development on a
live-action Star Wars television series by 2009, but the
project was deemed too expensive to produce. After he
sold Lucasfilm to Disney in October 2012, work on a new
Star Wars series began for Disney+. Favreau signed on in
March 2018, serving as writer and showrunner. He
executive produces alongside Dave Filoni, Kathleen
Kennedy, and Colin Wilson. The series' title was
announced in October 2018 with the start of filming at
Manhattan Beach Studios in California. Visual effects
company Industrial Light & Magic developed the
StageCraft technology for the series, using virtual sets and
a 360-degree video wall to create the series' environments.
This has since been adopted by other film and television
productions.
The Mandalorian premiered on Disney+ on November 12,
2019. The eight-episode first season was met with positive
reviews. It was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at
the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards and won seven
Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. A second season
premiered on October 30, 2020, and development work on
a third season has begun.

Title

Cast and characters
Pedro Pascal stars as Din Djarin, the series' title character and a lone bounty hunter.[2][9][10] Pascal compared
the character to Clint Eastwood, with advanced combat skills and of "questionable moral character".[11] The
character's real name is not given until "Chapter 8: Redemption", but Pascal accidentally revealed it early in
November 2019.[10] His bounty in "Chapter 1: The Mandalorian" is "The Child"—colloquially known as
"Baby Yoda" by audience members—an infant of the same species as Star Wars character Yoda. He is created
with animatronics and puppetry, augmented with visual effects. He becomes the Mandalorian's ward,[3] and
his name is revealed to be Grogu in "Chapter 13: The Jedi".[4]

The first season features several recurring co-stars, including Carl Weathers as Greef Karga, leader of a bounty
hunter guild;[12][11] Werner Herzog as "The Client", an enigmatic man;[12][13] Omid Abtahi as Dr. Pershing, a
scientist working for the client;[12][14] Nick Nolte as the voice of Kuiil, an Ugnaught moisture farmer who
helps the Mandalorian;[15][16] Taika Waititi as the voice of IG-11, a bounty hunter droid;[17][11] Gina Carano
as Cara Dune, a former Rebel shock trooper-turned-mercenary;[18][11] Giancarlo Esposito as Moff Gideon, a
former officer of the Imperial Security Bureau;[12][19] and Emily Swallow as "The Armorer", a Mandalorian
who forges armor and equipment from Beskar steel.[12][20]
For the second season, recurring co-stars include Amy Sedaris as Peli Motto, reprising her role from the first
season,[21] Misty Rosas as the Frog Lady,[22] Esposito, and Carano.[5] Weathers and Abtahi also return for the
second season.[5][23] Several actors appear as characters from previous Star Wars media, including Timothy
Olyphant as Cobb Vanth,[24][21] Temuera Morrison as Boba Fett,[25][26] Katee Sackhoff as Bo-Katan
Kryze,[27][28] and Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano.[29][4]

Production
Background
Star Wars creator George Lucas began development on a live-action Star Wars television series known as
Underworld in early 2009. More than 50 scripts were written for the series by 2012, but they were eventually
deemed too expensive to produce.[30] In January 2013, ABC president Paul Lee stated that his network would
be discussing potential live-action Star Wars television series with Lucasfilm after the latter had been sold by
Lucas to ABC's parent company The Walt Disney Company in October 2012.[31] In November 2017, Disney
CEO Bob Iger announced that Disney and Lucasfilm were developing a live-action Star Wars television series
for the new streaming service Disney+.[32]

Development
While working on The Lion King (2019), a photo-realistic remake of the 1994 animated film, in 2017, director
Jon Favreau pitched an idea he had for a Star Wars television series to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.
Kennedy suggested Favreau discuss the idea with Dave Filoni, executive producer on the animated series Star
Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels.[33] Favreau and Filoni had met at the Skywalker Ranch when
Favreau was working on Iron Man (2008) and Filoni was working on the first season of The Clone Wars, and
Favreau subsequently voiced the Mandalorian character Pre Vizsla in The Clone Wars for Filoni.[11] When
Favreau met with Filoni about his series idea, the latter drew a doodle of a baby of the same species as the Star
Wars character Yoda which became "The Child".[33] Favreau wanted to explore the "scum and villainy" of the
Star Wars universe following the events of the film Return of the Jedi (1983).[11] He began spending several
hours at the end of each day developing the series while he was directing The Lion King.[33]
Lucasfilm announced that Favreau would write and executive produce a new Star Wars series for Disney+ in
March 2018. Kennedy added that the series was an opportunity for a diverse group of writers and directors to
be hired to create Star Wars stories, after the franchise's films had been criticized for being written and directed
by only white men.[34] In May, Favreau stated that he had written scripts for four of the series' eight episodes
before being officially hired for the project.[35] On October 3, Favreau announced that the series was titled The
Mandalorian and revealed the premise for the show.[2] The following day, Lucasfilm announced that Filoni,
Kennedy, and Colin Wilson would executive produce the series alongside Favreau, with Karen Gilchrist
acting as co-executive producer.[36] The series premiere was set to be available with the launch of Disney+ in
November 2019.[37] Star Pedro Pascal described the series as taking the space Western undertones from the
Star Wars films "and infusing it with steroids".[38]

In July 2019, Favreau confirmed that there would be a second season of the series and that he had begun
writing it.[39] Iger announced in February 2020 that the second season would premiere that October.[40] By
late April, Favreau had been writing a third season for "a while" and further development on the season was
beginning.[41] In September, co-star Giancarlo Esposito said the second season would "start to lay the
groundwork for the depth and breadth that’s going to come in season 3 and season 4, where you’re really
gonna start to get answers."[42] The following month, filming on the third season was expected to begin by the
end of 2020.[43]

Casting
In November 2018, Pedro Pascal was confirmed to be portraying the Mandalorian after being rumored to be
cast in the role for some time.[9] Pascal initially thought he was being cast as the Star Wars character Boba Fett
due to the visual similarities between that character and the Mandalorian,[44] but the latter is actually a separate
character named Din Djarin.[10] Favreau called Pascal "a classic movie star" who "had the presence and
skill[s]" necessary to portray a character largely concealed under a helmet.[45] The Mandalorian is also
portrayed by stunt doubles Brendan Wayne and Lateef Crowder.[46] Pascal worked with Favreau and Filoni to
record the character's dialogue later.[47][45]

Filming
The series is filmed at Manhattan Beach Studios in California.[3] Filoni directed the series' first episode,
making his live-action directorial debut,[36][48] with Rick Famuyiwa, Deborah Chow, Bryce Dallas Howard,
and Taika Waititi also directing for the first season.[36] Filoni,[49] Howard,[50] and Famuyiwa returned for the
second season,[51] and are joined by Favreau, who was unable to direct in the first season due to his
commitments to The Lion King,[48] Peyton Reed,[52] co-star Carl Weathers,[53] and Robert Rodriguez.[52]

New technology
Visual effects studio Industrial Light & Magic, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, opened a new division in November
2018 called ILM TV, specifically intended for episodic and streaming television. Based in London with
support from ILM's San Francisco, Vancouver, and Singapore locations, one of the first projects for the new
division was The Mandalorian.[54] While directing The Jungle Book (2016), Favreau had used large screens
on set to create interactive lighting so when live action footage was combined with a digital environment in
post-production the effect would be more realistic. He found the process to be effective, but time
consuming.[55] When he began working on The Lion King, Favreau worked with visual effects vendor
Moving Picture Company, technology developer Magnopus, and the game engine software Unity to develop a
new virtual camera system that allowed him to film scenes in a virtual reality environment as if he was filming
with physical cameras. For The Lion King, the results of the virtual photography were then rendered by MPC
as final animation for the film.[3] On The Mandalorian, Favreau wanted to use the virtual technology to aid
live action photography and also develop the video wall system.[3][55] ILM partnered with video game
developer Epic Games to create a new system named StageCraft based on Epic's game engine Unreal Engine.
StageCraft consists of large LED video screens on which digital environments can be rendered in real time for
actors to perform in front of.[56][3]
During pre-production, the virtual photography process developed for The Lion King was used to plan the
series' filming and determine what environments would be needed on set. The digital environments were then
created by ILM and added to StageCraft ready for live action photography with the actors. Some of these
environments were based on location photography in countries such as Iceland and Chile, on which Favreau
said, "The actors aren't brought on location. The location is brought to the actors."[3] The environments were

designed by the series' visual art department, led by Lucasfilm's creative director Doug Chiang and production
designer Andrew L. Jones.[57] During filming, the digital environments were rendered on a video wall in real
time, allowing the filmmakers and actors to see the environments.[56] ILM used a smaller version of the
technology for Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), but on The Mandalorian they utilized a 21 feet (6.4 m) tall set
that was 75 feet (23 m) in diameter, surrounded by a 360-degree semicircular LED video wall and ceiling. The
Manhattan Beach Studios set is referred to as a "volume", which is traditionally the name for motion capture
stages.[56][3] Favreau's initial intention was to use the video wall as a way to provide realistic interactive
lighting for the actors, with a section of the screen behind the actors displaying a green screen so a higher
quality version of the background could be added in post-production. During filming tests with the technology,
the team realized that the Unreal Engine could render visuals fast enough that they could have the background
move in relation to the camera. This allowed the system to maintain the appearance of parallax, where the
environment would appear differently based on the angle it was being looked at just as a real 3D environment
would. This effect causes some distortion to the image on the video wall, but looks like a real environment
when viewed through the camera.[55] The images rendered on the video wall in real time were often of a high
enough quality to be used as final effects when filmed on set.[56]
Physical elements were added to the volume to match the digital backgrounds, such as dirt on the floor to
match dirt displayed on the video wall.[55] Interior spaces were also created, such as an office used by Imperial
agents where the walls and ceiling were displayed on the video wall around a physical table.[56] The
production had several physical sections of the Razor Crest, the Mandalorian's ship, that could be placed
within the volume, such as having the front half of the ship physically built and the back half rendered
digitally.[55][56] The environments could be manipulated in StageCraft on set as required, allowing the
filmmakers to request changes to the environment and have them rendered on the video wall on the same
day.[56] The production was able to change between environments within half an hour, or even faster if the
physical elements within the volume were not visible and did not need to be changed.[55] One of the primary
advantages of using the video wall technology was the realistic lighting, with the wall providing ambient light
and accurate reflections on the actors. This was especially important for the Mandalorian, who wears reflective
armor. Traditionally, on a production using green screen, the visual effects team would have to remove the
green reflections from a reflective character or object in post-production, and then add new reflections that
matched the digital environment. Using StageCraft, the reflections in the Mandalorian's armor were already
correct on set. It also allowed for the series' cinematographers to light scenes in a way that would match the
background, rather than lighting the set and hoping the digital background would match in post-production as
they would have to do with green screen. A technique used by the production to ensure the lighting from the
video wall looked natural was to have the actors in shadow, with light from the environment behind them,
often creating silhouettes.[55]

Music
Composer Ludwig Göransson was recommended by several of his previous collaborators to Favreau,
including directors Ryan Coogler and Anthony and Joe Russo, and musician Donald Glover. Favreau knew
that music would be important to the series due to the impact of John Williams' score on the Star Wars films,
but also wanted the music of the series to be different from the films. He wanted the series to sound "a little
grittier, a little edgier and a little more tech-oriented".[58] Göransson first met with Favreau in November
2018,[59] when Favreau showed the composer concept art for the series and discussed his inspirations for the
story and tone, including Western and samurai films. They also discussed how they felt when they first heard
Williams' Star Wars music, and Göransson set out to recreate those feelings and "capture the soul of what Star
Wars is" but in a new way.[60]
Göransson was announced as composer for the series in December 2018.[61] The basis of the main theme was
created from Göransson experimenting with a bass recorder, digitally manipulating it to make it more
"futuristic". Guitars, a piano, drums, and synthesizers are also featured in the main theme.[60] A 70-piece

orchestra was used for the first season,[58][59] combined with recordings of Göransson playing the main
instruments which he augmented with synthesizers and other digital manipulation.[59] Walt Disney Records
released a soundtrack album for each episode of the first season.[59] Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
orchestra players were recorded remotely or in smaller, distant groups for the second season.[5] An album for
the first four episodes of the second season has been released, and another will be for the final four
episodes.[62]

Themes
Parenting and fatherhood
One of the primary themes of The Mandalorian is parenting and fatherhood, particularly through the father–
son relationship dynamic between The Mandalorian and The Child.[63][64][65] Ryan Britt of Fatherly wrote
that this is unusual in Star Wars stories, and that past examples of parenting in the franchise have tended to be
poor ones, from the murderous Darth Vader (father of Luke Skywalker) to the neglectful Galen Erso, father of
Jyn Erso in Rogue One (2016).[63] Britt wrote: "For years the Star Wars franchise avoided depicting a parentchild dynamic. With Mando and Baby Yoda, that's finally changing."[63] The dynamic between Kuiil and IG11 also reflect the childrearing theme in The Mandalorian. The two have a relationship similar to that of a
father and son, as demonstrated in the scene in which Kuiil teaches IG-11 how to operate and function after
the droid is reprogrammed.[66]
Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk argued that parenting has been the subject of past Star Wars stories, but
almost always during later stages of parenthood, rather than an infant in early stages such as the Child. As
examples, she cited Obi-Wan Kenobi serving as a mentor to the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, Princess Leia
lamenting over her grown son Kylo Ren, or the absence of Rey's parents.[67] Britt argued strong parental
examples in Star Wars are important because the franchise is so often associated with the childhoods of its
fans.[63] The Mandalorian particularly highlights the challenges of being a single parent,[64][65] and a working
parent, as the Mandalorian struggles to continue his day job as a bounty hunter and mercenary while serving as
the sole caretaker of the Child.[67][65] Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter described the show as "the
adventures of a single dad looking for a job".[68] Several reviewers have compared the dynamic between the
Child and the Mandalorian to Lone Wolf and Cub, a manga about a samurai warrior and his young
son.[69][70][71][72] Favreau acknowledged Lone Wolf and Cub as an influence in an episode of Disney
Gallery: The Mandalorian.[73]
The Mandalorian's parental role in the series makes him a softer and more relatable character;[74] he changes in
a positive way because of raising the Child, becoming less selfish and self-absorbed.[75] He risked his life and
drastically changed his career as a bounty hunter to accept his responsibility as the Child's caretaker and
guardian,[64][65] marking a significant parental sacrifice.[65] When the Mandalorian seeks work to earn money,
he is now doing so to provide not only for himself, but for the Child as well.[64] We see several examples of
the Mandalorian parenting the Child throughout the series, such as when he stops the Child from pressing
random buttons in the cockpit of the Mandalorian's spaceship, ultimately by holding him in his lap.[63] In
another example, the Mandalorian establishes a car seat for the Child in the cockpit of his ship, so he can be
seated safely and comfortably during their travels.[76]
The relationship between the Mandalorian and the Child is an example of unexpected fatherhood.[67][75] The
Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was
orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a "foundling".[67]
Nevertheless, fatherhood is not a role the Mandalorian initially seeks, and he makes repeated initial attempts to
avoid this responsibility. He first does so in "Chapter 3: The Sin", when he first leave the Child with the
Client.[75] He does so again in "Chapter 4" Sanctuary", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a

protective mother on the planet Sorgan, who is willing to take the Child into her own family. The Mandalorian
does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, "Chapter 8: Redemption", when the
Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a "foundling" and the Mandalorian is formally
declared to be his father figure.[67] He nonetheless continues to search for what he feels may be a more
appropriate guardian for the Child, as in the second season's fifth episode, "The Jedi", in which he seeks to
leave him with Ahsoka Tano.[77]
Several writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a tabula rasa effect and his
anonymity allows viewers to see and imagine themselves as parents.[63][64] Britt said this "allow(s) us to
dream about what arsenal we might deploy to protect our children".[63] However, Singer said the show's
setting in space make the challenges of child-rearing seem more exciting and exotic than they might otherwise
be.[64] Anthony Breznican of Vanity Fair has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are
portrayed in the series: "There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no
uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent's psyche like a dentist's drill shredding a soft, pink
nerve."[78] Likewise, Vulture writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many
parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes to sleep, and
whether he wears diapers. She wrote: "The Mandalorian is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a
very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff."[67] VanAnderonk
described this as a wish fulfillment fantasy for parents or prospective parents: "a vision of parenting stripped so
thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the child".[67]
The Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11,
and Peli Motto.[67] Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly
leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,[64] as well as for making decisions that place the
Child in danger. One example is in "Chapter 6: The Prisoner", when he allows a team of dangerous
mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.[64][79] An
interaction the Mandalorian has with Peli Motto in "Chapter 5: The Gunslinger" is one of the most overt
discussions about the challenges of caring for the Child. When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child,
who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: "Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to
sleep?"[67] She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: "you have an
awful lot to learn about raising a young one".[80] ScreenCrush writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's
parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing because making mistakes is a large part of being a
parent.[64] Eileen Chase of Today echoed this: "He is not an ideal parent, just like the rest of us who have to
balance parenting and work."[65]

Good and evil; nature versus nurture
The nature of good and evil and the question of nature versus nurture is raised repeatedly throughout The
Mandalorian, perhaps most overtly through by Kuiil's reprogramming of IG-11 from a bounty hunter to a
nurse droid and protector.[81][82] Even after IG-11 is reprogrammed, the Mandalorian does not believe he has
truly changed, because he believes droids have an essential nature and that IG-11's nature remains murderous
and untrustworthy.[83] But in reprogramming IG-11, Kuiil nurtures him and helps him to change; Kuiil feels
that in the process of learning how to function again, IG-11 gained a new personality.[84] Kuiil insists to the
Mandalorian: "Droids are not good or bad — they are neutral reflections of those who program them."[82]
Keith Phipps of Vulture wrote of IG-11 and the nature versus nurture theme: "He's not bad. He's just
programmed that way, and with care and change he can do a lot of good in the world."[81]
The Kuiil and IG-11 scenes also demonstrate that the way in which the "child" character is raised makes a
significant difference in whether the child becomes an asset or a threat to those around him. The droid was a
dangerous assassin before Kuiil reprogrammed him, but thanks to the Ugnaught's parenting, he becomes a
protector and helper instead.[66] Some writers have likewise suggested the Child is not inherently good or

evil,[82][85] but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events
occurring around him. He is learning about the world around him and needs guidance as he develops his
abilities.[79][82][86] It will largely fall to the Mandalorian to provide this guidance,[79] as when the Mandalorian
stops him from strangling Cara Dune.[82]
However, multiple writers have questioned whether the violent acts the Child has repeatedly witnessed
throughout The Mandalorian are having a negative impact on his development, and that he is learning to
become violent himself as a result.[82][87] Phipps wrote of this: "That look of wonder in the Child's eyes as IG11 kills and kills again is hilarious, but also a little chilling."[81] One particular scene in "Chapter 7: The
Reckoning" led many reviewers and fans to question whether the Child may be demonstrating evil tendencies.
During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage
in a friendly arm wrestling match. During the contest, the Child uses the Force to choke Cara, nearly strangling
her before the Mandalorian intervened.[85][86][87] Throughout the Star Wars franchise, that ability has been
most commonly associated with the Dark Side of the Force, particularly Darth Vader.[87][88][89]
Sarah Bea Milner of Screen Rant wrote: "The moment is genuinely shocking — and more than a little
disturbing."[82] Some reviewers noted, however, that the Child likely mistakenly believed the Mandalorian
was in danger and intervened to help.[89][90] Additionally, in the same episode, the Child uses Force healing to
save Greef Karga, a power typically associated with the Light Side.[82][85][90] Nevertheless, some writers
have suggested viewers had been underestimating the Child's capacity for evil because he is so
adorable.[89][88][91] Fans speculated the Child could be presenting a false personality or using the Force to
manipulate people into caring about him to help ensure his survival.[87] However, Caitlin Gallagher of Bustle
suggested rather than building toward making the Child evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian
needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.[87]

Release
The Mandalorian premiered on the streaming service Disney+ on its United States launch day, November 12,

Industry impact
The Mandalorian was the first production to be filmed using real time rendering for realistic, parallax
environments.[55] Favreau believed that the StageCraft technology developed for the series would have a
significant impact on the production of films and television series moving forward.[56] He attributed the
breakthroughs made with the technology to the support of Kathleen Kennedy, who was in charge of both
Lucasfilm and ILM, as well as to his own drive for innovation, and to previous work done by George Lucas
on new technology for the Star Wars films. Favreau also acknowledged that much of the technology involved
in StageCraft is not proprietary and is readily available to others, it just had not been combined in this way
before.[55] Favreau invited other filmmakers and studios to visit the series' set and see how the new technology
was being used, noting that Lucas and other filmmakers such as James Cameron had done the same when they
had been working on innovative film projects. Favreau added that the companies working on the series' new
technologies—including ILM, Epic, and MPC—were being encouraged to share their work and develop the
technology further beyond the requirements of the series.[3] Several actors working on the series, including
Carl Weathers and Giancarlo Esposito, gave high praise to the technology and the way it allowed them to act
within the environment rather than pretend in front of green screen.[55] After learning lessons about the
technology during production on the first season of The Mandalorian, ILM was able to make several

advancements beginning with the second season. This included transitioning StageCraft to a fully in-house
product utilizing ILM's own game engine, Helios, rather than Epic's Unreal Engine.[57] In February 2020,
ILM announced that it was making its StageCraft technology available to all filmmakers and production
studios as a complete end-to-end solution.[56]

Possible spin-offs
In November 2019, Walt Disney Studios CCO Alan Horn said if the series was successful, a film featuring the
Mandalorian could be developed.[105] The next month, Favreau said there was an opportunity to explore the
series' characters in other Star Wars films or television series.[3] In February 2020, Bob Iger said spin-offs of
The Mandalorian were being considered, including the potential to add more characters to the series with the
intention of then giving them their own series.[106] Speaking to this in October 2020, Favreau said as more
characters are being introduced through the series, "we are beginning to explore where we could go", and
given the faster production time for television series than films, Lucasfilm could be "more responsive" to
audience reactions to determine potential spin-offs. Additionally, Favreau looked to his experience working in
the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where smaller stories exist within the larger narrative, as a potential guide for
spin-offs. As for the potential for the character to appear in a Star Wars film, Favreau and Pascal were both
open to the idea, but Favreau was in "no rush" to expand the series.[43] By November 2020, a miniseries
focused on Boba Fett was being considered, with the potential for that project to film from the middle of
November until early 2021, ahead of filming on season three of The Mandalorian.[107]

Other media
Documentary series
The documentary series, Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian, features interviews with the cast and crew of The
Mandalorian, behind-the-scenes footage, and roundtable conversations hosted by Favreau that explore the
production of the series. It premiered on Disney+ on May 4, 2020, Star Wars Day, for the first season.[108]
The series will return to cover the second season, beginning on December 25, 2020.[109]

Publishing
Lucasfilm announced a publishing campaign of tie-in books and comics for the series in June 2020. The
campaign includes The Art of The Mandalorian (Season One) by Phil Szostak, an original adult novel written
by Adam Christopher and published by Del Rey Books, a visual guide written by Pablo Hidalgo and
published by DK, a junior novelization of the first season written by Joe Schreiber, and comic books inspired
by the series to be published by Marvel Comics and IDW.[110]

Video games
In November 2020, Minecraft released a Star Wars-themed downloadable content, which included locations
and characters from The Mandalorian.[111] Din Djarin and Grogu appear in Fortnite Battle Royale's chapter
two, season five event, Zero Point. Djarin's sniper rifle and jetpack were also available as items.[112]
