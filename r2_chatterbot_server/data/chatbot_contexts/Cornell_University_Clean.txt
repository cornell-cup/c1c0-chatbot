Cornell University
Cornell University (/kɔːrˈnɛl/ kor-NEL) is a private and statutory
Ivy League research university in Ithaca, New York. Founded in
1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White,[7] the university
was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of
knowledge—from the classics to the sciences, and from the
theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time,
are captured in Cornell's founding principle, a popular 1868
quotation from founder Ezra Cornell: "I would found an institution
where any person can find instruction in any study."[8]
The university is broadly organized into seven undergraduate
colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus,
with each college and division defining its specific admission
standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university
also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York
City and one in Education City, Qatar, and Cornell Tech, a
graduate program that incorporates technology, business, and
creative thinking. The program moved from Google's Chelsea
Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt
Island in September 2017.
Cornell is one of the few private land grant universities in the
United States.[note 1] Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are
state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State
University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural
and human ecology colleges as well as its industrial labor relations
school. Of Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is
state-supported. As a land grant college, Cornell operates a
cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New
York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for
certain educational missions.[9] The Cornell University Ithaca
Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell
Botanic Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) and the numerous
university-owned lands in New York City are considered.[10]
Alumni and affiliates of Cornell have reached many notable and
influential positions in politics, media, and science. As of
November 2020, 61 Nobel laureates, four Turing Award winners
and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Cornell
University. Cornell counts more than 250,000 living alumni, and its
former and present faculty and alumni include 33 Marshall
Scholars, 33 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman Scholars, 7 Gates
Scholars, 55 Olympic Medalists, 10 current Fortune 500 CEOs, and
35 billionaire alumni.[11][12][13][14][15] Since its founding, Cornell
has been a co-educational, non-sectarian institution where

History
Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865; the New York State (NYS) Senate authorized the
university as the state's land grant institution. Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York, as a
site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment. Fellow senator and educator Andrew
Dickson White agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of
the first two buildings and traveled to attract students and faculty.[16] The university was inaugurated on
October 7, 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day.[17]
Cornell developed as a technologically innovative
institution, applying its research to its own campus and to
outreach efforts. For example, in 1883 it was one of the
first university campuses to use electricity from a waterpowered dynamo to light the grounds.[18] Since 1894,
Cornell has included colleges that are state funded and
fulfill statutory requirements;[19] it has also administered
research and extension activities that have been jointly
funded by state and federal matching programs.[20]

Cornell's founders

Cornell has had active alumni since its earliest classes. It
was one of the first universities to include alumni-elected
Ezra Cornell
Andrew Dickson White
representatives on its Board of Trustees.[note 2] Cornell
was also among the Ivies that had heightened student
activism during the 1960s related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to the Vietnam War; with
protests and occupations resulting in the resignation of Cornell's president and the restructuring of university
governance.[24] Today the university has more than 4,000 courses.[25] Cornell is also known for the
Residential Club Fire of 1967, a fire in the Residential Club building that killed eight students and one
professor.
Since 2000, Cornell has been expanding its international programs. In 2004, the university opened the Weill
Cornell Medical College in Qatar.[26] It has partnerships with institutions in India, Singapore, and the People's
Republic of China.[27][28][29] Former president Jeffrey S. Lehman described the university, with its high
international profile, a "transnational university".[30] On March 9, 2004, Cornell and Stanford University laid
the cornerstone for a new 'Bridging the Rift Center' to be built and jointly operated for education on the Israel–
Jordan border.[31]

Campuses
Ithaca campus
Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in Ithaca, New York,
overlooking the city and Cayuga Lake. Since the university was
founded, it has expanded to about 2,300 acres (9.3 km2 ),
encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.[32]
Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost
all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums,
and museums. North Campus is composed of ten residence halls[33]
that primarily house first-year students, although the Townhouse
Community occasionally houses transfer students. The five main
residence halls on West Campus make up the West Campus House

System, along with several Gothic-style buildings, referred to as "the
Gothics".[34] Collegetown contains two upper-level residence
halls[35][36] and the Schwartz Performing Arts Center amid a mixeduse neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.[37]
The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic
architectural styles, including ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and
Neoclassical buildings, and the more spare international and
modernist structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate
World War II. The student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to
15,000 by 1970, at a time when architectural styles favored
modernism.[38] While some buildings are neatly arranged into
quadrangles, others are packed densely and haphazardly. These
eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing
master plans for the campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans,
Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a
"grand terrace" overlooking Cayuga Lake.[39]
Several of the university buildings are listed as historic landmarks.[40]
Those listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the
Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, Caldwell Hall, the
Computing and Communications Center (formerly Comstock Hall),
Morrill Hall, Rice Hall, Fernow Hall, Wing Hall, Llenroc, and 13
South Avenue (Deke House).[41] At least three other historic
buildings—the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall and Stone Hall
—have also been listed on the NRHP. The university demolished
them in the 1980s to make way for other development.[42] In
September 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Ithaca Campus as among
States.[43]

Located among the rolling valleys of the Finger Lakes region, the campus on a hill provides views of the
surrounding area, including 38 miles (61.4 km) long Cayuga Lake. Two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and
Cascadilla Gorge, bound Central Campus and are used as popular swimming holes during the warmer months
(although the university and city code discourage their use due to hazardous swimming conditions).[44]
Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800 acre (11.6 km2 ) Cornell Botanic Gardens, a botanical
garden containing flowers, trees, and ponds, with manicured trails providing access through the facility.[45]
The university has embarked on numerous 'green' initiatives. In 2009, a new gas-fired combined heat and
power facility replaced a coal-fired steam plant, resulting in a reduction in carbon emissions to 7% below 1990
levels, and projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75,000 tons per year.[46] This facility satisfies 15%
of campus electrical needs,[47] and a university-run, on-campus hydroelectric plant in the Fall Creek Gorge
provides an additional 2%.[48] The university has a lake source cooling project that uses Cayuga Lake to air
condition campus buildings, with an 80% energy saving over conventional systems.[49] In 2007, Cornell
established a Center for a Sustainable Future.[50] Cornell has been rated "A-" by the 2011 College
Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[51] However, the university has
drawn criticism from student groups for a planned North Campus expansion for which they have not released
an environmental impact statement.[52]

New York City campuses

Weill Cornell
Cornell's medical campus in New York, also called Weill Cornell, is
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City. It is home to
two Cornell divisions: Weill Cornell Medical College and Weill
Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated
with the NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital since 1927.[53] Although
their faculty and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Center
shares administrative and teaching hospital functions with the
Columbia University Medical Center.[54] These teaching hospitals
include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan and the Westchester
Weill Medical Center overlooks the
Division in White Plains, New York.[55] Weill Cornell Medical
East River in New York City.
College is also affiliated with the neighboring Memorial Sloan–
Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for
Special Surgery. Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions. Weill Cornell,
Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program to selected entering
Cornell medical students.[56] From 1942 to 1979, the campus also housed the Cornell School of Nursing.[57]
Cornell Tech
On December 19, 2011, Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology won a competition for
rights to claim free city land and $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City.
The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to increase entrepreneurship
and job growth in the city's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square feet state-ofthe-art tech campus to be built on Roosevelt Island on the site of the former Coler-Goldwater Specialty
Hospital. Instruction began in the fall of 2012 in a temporary location in Manhattan (111 Eighth Avenue in
space donated by Google).[58] Thom Mayne of the architecture firm Morphosis has been selected to design the
first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island. Begun in 2014, construction of the first phase of the
campus was completed in September 2017.[59]
Other New York City programs
In addition to the tech campus and medical center, Cornell maintains local offices in New York City for some
of its service programs. The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service
careers, arranging assignments with organizations working with New York City's poorest children, families,
and communities.[60] The NYS College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Agriculture and Life
Sciences enable students to reach out to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell
Cooperative Extension.[61] Students with the NYS School of Industrial and Labor Relations' Extension &
Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to organizations, union members, policymakers, and
working adults.[62] The College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's financial
district, brings together business optimization research and decision support services addressed to both
financial applications and public health logistics planning.[63] The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning
has an 11,000 square foot Gensler-designed facility in 26 Broadway (The Standard Oil Building) in the
Financial District that opened in 2015.[64]

Qatar campus
Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is in Education City, near Doha. Opened in September 2004, this is
the first American medical school to be established outside the United States. The college is part of Cornell's
program to increase its international influence. The college is a joint initiative with the Qatar government,

which seeks to improve the country's academic programs and medical
care.[26] Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors the
curriculum taught at Weill Medical College in New York City, the
college offers a two-year undergraduate pre-medical program with a
separate admissions process. This undergraduate program opened in
September 2002 and was the first coeducational institute of higher
education in Qatar.[65]
The college is partially funded by the Qatar government through the
Qatar Foundation, which contributed $750 million for its
Weill Cornell Medical College in
construction.[66] The medical center is housed in a large two-story
Qatar
structure designed by Arata Isozaki, an internationally known
Japanese architect.[67] In 2004, the Qatar Foundation announced the
construction of a 350-bed Specialty Teaching Hospital near the medical college in Education City. The
hospital was to be completed in a few years.[26]

Other facilities
Cornell University owns and/or operates other facilities.[68] The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, site of
the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, was operated by Cornell under a contract with the National
Science Foundation from its construction until 2011.[69] The Shoals Marine Laboratory, operated in
conjunction with the University of New Hampshire,[70] is a seasonal marine field station dedicated to
undergraduate education and research on the 95-acre (0.4 km2 ) Appledore Island off the Maine–New
Hampshire coast.[71]
Cornell has facilities devoted to conservation and ecology. The New
York State Agricultural Experiment Station, operated by the College
of Agriculture and Life Sciences, is in Geneva, New York, 50 miles
(80 km) northwest of the main campus. It operates three substations:
The Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory
(CLEREL) in Portland, New York,[72] Hudson Valley Laboratory in
Highland,[73] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory
in Riverhead.[74]

evidence and subsequent surveys were inconclusive).[76] The Animal
Science Teaching and Research Center in Harford, New York, and
the Duck Research Laboratory in Eastport, New York, are resources
for information on animal disease control and husbandry.[77][78]

operates the Freeville Organic Research Farm and Homer C. Thompson Vegetable Research Farm in

Freeville, New York.[13] The university operates biodiversity laboratories in Punta Cana, Dominican
Republic,[80] and one in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest (Cornell University Esbaran Amazon Field
Laboratory).[81]
The university arranges study abroad and scholarship programs. The Cornell in Washington is a program that
allows students to study for a semester in Washington, D.C., holding research or internship positions while
earning credit toward a degree.[82] Cornell in Rome, operated by the College of Architecture, Art, and
Planning, allows students to use the city as a resource for learning architecture, urban studies, and art.[83]
Similarly, the Capital Semester program allows students to intern in the New York state legislature in Albany.
As New York State's land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension service with 56 offices
spread out across the state, each staffed with extension educators who offer programs in five subjects:
Agriculture and Food Systems; Children, Youth, and Families; Community and Economic Vitality;
Environment and Natural Resources; and Nutrition and Health.[84] Cornell also operates New York's Animal
Health Diagnostic Center.[85]

Organization and administration
Cornell is a non-profit organization governed by a 64-member
Board of Trustees consisting of both privately and publicly
appointed trustees. Three trustees are appointed by the
Governor of New York: one seat is reserved for the eldest lineal
descendant of Ezra Cornell; two members from each of the
fields of agriculture, business, and labor in New York state;
eight trustees to be elected from among and by the alumni of
the university; two trustees to be elected from among and by the
faculty of the university at Ithaca and Geneva; two trustees to
be elected from among and by the membership of the
university's student body at Ithaca (one undergraduate and one
graduate student);[86] and one trustee to be elected from among
and by the nonacademic staff and employees of the university
at Ithaca and Geneva, 37 trustees at large and finally, the
Governor, Temporary President of the Senate, Speaker of the
Assembly, and president of the university serve in an ex officio
voting capacity.[87][88] Robert Harrison has served as the
chairman of the board since 2014.[89] The board elects a
President to serve as the chief executive and educational
officer.[87]
Martha E. Pollack was inaugurated as Cornell's fourteenth
president on August 25, 2017.[90][91] She succeeded Elizabeth
Garrett, who served from July 2015 until her death from colon
cancer on March 6, 2016 — the first Cornell president to die
while in office.[92][93]

The Board of Trustees hold four regular meetings each year, and portions of those meetings are subject to the
New York State Open Meetings Law.[94]
Cornell consists of nine privately endowed and four publicly supported "statutory colleges": the New York
State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor
Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. These statutory colleges received $131.9 million in SUNY
appropriations in 2010–2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, which makes them

accountable to SUNY trustees and other state agencies. The budget also includes $3.9 million of state funds
for Cornell Cooperative Extension.[95][96][97] Residents of New York enrolled in these colleges also qualify
for discounted tuition.[98] However, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer issued a 2005 opinion asserting that, with
respect to their academic activities, statutory colleges should be understood to be private, non-state parties.[9]:1
Cornell is decentralized, with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy. Each defines its own
academic programs, operates its own admissions and advising programs, and confers its own degrees. The
only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical
education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. A handful of inter-school academic departments offer
courses in more than one college.[99][100] All academic departments are affiliated with at least one college; the
last department without such an affiliation, the Cornell Africana Studies and Research Center, merged with the
College of Arts and Sciences in July 2011.[101]

Seven schools provide undergraduate programs and an additional
seven provide graduate and professional programs. Students pursuing
graduate degrees in departments of these schools are enrolled in the
Graduate School. The School of Continuing Education and Summer
Sessions offers programs for college and high school students,
professionals, and other adults.[102] Of the 15,182 undergraduate
students, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by
enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in
Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences. By
student enrollment, the smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is
Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.[3]

Several other universities have used Cornell as their model, including
Stanford University, the University of Sydney in Australia, and the
University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom; the last did so on
the recommendation of one of its financiers, Andrew Carnegie, who was a Cornell Trustee.[103]
The university also operates eCornell, which offers both certificate programs and professional development
courses online.[104] In addition to being New York's land-grant college, Cornell is also a partner in New
York's sea-grant program,[105] and is a part of New York's space-grant consortium.[106] The university
previously served as the hub of the Northeast's sun-grant program,[107] but the hub has since moved to
Pennsylvania State University.
In 2015, Cornell ranked fifth among universities in the U.S. in fund-raising, collecting $591 million in private
support.[108] In addition to the central University development staff located in Ithaca and New York City, each
college and program has its own staffed fundraising program. In 2006, Cornell launched a $4 billion
fundraising campaign, which reached $3 billion in November 2010.[109] In 2013, Cornell's "Cornell Now"
fundraising campaign raised over $475 million.[110]

Academics
Cornell is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority of enrollments in undergraduate
programs.[111] The university has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education
since 1921.[112] Cornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall term beginning in late August
and ending in early December, a three-week winter session in January, and the spring term beginning in late
January and ending in early May.[113]

Cornell, Oregon State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Georgia, and University of
Hawaii at Manoa are the only institutions to be members of all four Land Grant, Sea Grant, Space Grant, and
Sun Grant programs.

Admissions
Admission to the university is highly competitive. For Fall 2019,
Cornell received 49,114 applications; 5,330 were admitted, a 10.9%
acceptance rate, and 3,189 enrolled.[114] For the Fall 2019 enrolling
freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680-760 for
evidence-based reading and writing, and 720-800 for math.[114] The
middle 50% range of the ACT Composite score was 32–35.[114]
As of Fall 2019, Cornell enrolled students from all 50 U.S. states and
119 countries, and 23% of undergraduate students identified
themselves as members of underrepresented minority groups.[3]
Legacy applicants receive a slight advantage in the admission
process.[115]

Financial aid
Section 9 of the original charter of Cornell University ensured that the
university "shall be open to applicants for admission ... at the lowest
rates of expense consistent with its welfare and efficiency, and
without distinction as to rank, class, previous occupation or
locality".[116] The University Charter provided for free instruction to
one student chosen from each Assembly district in the state.[116]
Starting in the 1950s Cornell coordinated with other Ivy League
The sarcophagus in Sage Chapel of
schools to provide a consistent set of financial aid. However, in 1989,
Jennie McGraw, Cornell
a consent decree to end a Justice Department antitrust investigation
benefactress
ended such coordination.[117] Even after the decree, all Ivy League
schools continue to award aid on financial need without offering any
athletic scholarships.[118] In December 2010, Cornell announced a policy of matching any grant component of
financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke University or Stanford, if an accepted applicant
is trying to decide between Cornell and those other schools.[119]
On January 31, 2008, Cornell announced a new financial aid initiative to be phased in over the following two
years. In the first year, 2008–2009, Cornell replaced need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate
students from families with incomes under $60,000 and capped such loans annually at $3,000 for students
from families with incomes between $60,000 and $120,000. The following year, 2009–2010, the program
improved by replacing loan with scholarships for students from families with incomes up to $75,000, and
capped annual loans at $3,000 for students from families with income between $75,000 and $120,000. For
families above $120,000, need-based loans were capped at $7,500 per year.[120] The initiative costs an
additional $14 million per year to fully implement.[121] Although Cornell's endowment dropped 27% in the
second half of 2008, its president announced that the financial aid initiative will continue by withdrawing an
additional $35 million from the endowment for undergraduate financial aid in 2009–10.[122] Cornell is seeking
$125 million in gifts to support the financial aid initiative.[123] In 2010, 1,647 of the 3,181 full-time freshmen

enrolled were found to have financial need (40%).[124] Of these, Cornell could meet the full financial aid
needs of all 1,647 freshmen. Cornell's average undergraduate student's indebtedness at graduation is
$21,549.[124]

International programs
Cornell University is a member of the United Nations Academic
Impact aligning institutions of higher education to the United Nations
and promoting international cooperation.
Cornell offers undergraduate curricula with international focuses,
including the Africana Studies, Asian-Pacific American Studies
French Studies, German Studies, Jewish Studies, Latino Studies, Near
Eastern Studies, Romance Studies, and Russian Literature majors.[13]
In addition to traditional academic programs, Cornell students may
study abroad on any of six continents.[125]

Students performing a Raas, a
traditional folk dance from India

The Asian Studies major, South Asia Program, South East Asia
Program and China and Asia-Pacific Studies (CAPS) major provide
opportunities for students and researchers in Asia. Cornell has an agreement with Peking University allowing
students in the CAPS major to spend a semester in Beijing.[126] Similarly, the College of Engineering has an
agreement to exchange faculty and graduate students with Tsinghua University in Beijing, and the School of
Hotel Administration has a joint master's program with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has signed an agreement with Japan's National Institute of
Agrobiological Sciences,[127] and with the University of the Philippines, Los Baños,[128] to engage in joint
research and exchange graduate students and faculty members. It also cooperates in agricultural research with
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.[129] Cornell also offers a course on International consulting in
association with Indian Institute of Management Bangalore[130]
In the Middle East, Cornell's efforts focus on biology and medicine. The Weill Cornell Medical College in
Qatar trains new doctors to improve health services in the region.[131] The university is also developing the
Bridging the Rift Center, a "Library of Life" (or database of all living systems) on the border of Israel and
Jordan, in collaboration with those two countries and Stanford University.[132] Cornell has partnered with
Queen's University in Canada to offer a joint Executive MBA. The innovative program includes both oncampus and videoconferencing-based, interactive virtual classroom sessions. Graduates of the program earn
both a Cornell MBA and a Queen's MBA.[133] Cornell also has an ILR exchange program with institutions
such as Bocconi University and the University of Warwick.

Rankings
Cornell is ranked 13th on average over the past 30 years by U.S. News & World Report National Universities
ranking.[134] In 2020 Cornell University ranked 7th in the US according to QS World University Rankings
and 9th according to Times Higher Education World University Rankings. In 2015, Cornell ranked 8th
domestically and 10th internationally in the CWUR rankings.[135] Cornell ranked 14th in the 2018 edition of
the QS World University Rankings and 19th in the 2017 edition of the Times Higher Education World
University Rankings.[136][137] The university ranked 10th in the 2013 Business Insider Best Colleges in
America ranking,[138] 13th globally in an academic ranking of world universities by Academic Ranking of
World Universities in 2015, and tied 6th in the United States by the U.S. News Academic Reputation peer

assessment score in 2020.[139][140] Cornell was ranked 27th nationally in The Washington Monthly's 2016
ranking of universities' contributions to research, community service, and social mobility.[141] In 2017, the
university was ranked 7th in The Princeton Review's "Top 50 Green Colleges".[142]
In its annual edition of "America's Best Architecture &
Design Schools", the journal Design Intelligence has
consistently ranked Cornell's Bachelor of Architecture
program as number one in the nation (2000–2002, 2005–
2007, 2009–2013 and 2015-2016). In the 2011 survey,
the program ranked first and the Master of Architecture
program ranked 6th.[143] In 2017, Design Intelligence
ranked Cornell's Master of Landscape Architecture
program 4th in the nation with the Bachelor of Science in
Landscape Architecture program ranking 5th among its
Cornell's 2008 commencement ceremony at
undergraduate counterparts.[144][145] Among business
Schoellkopf Field
schools in the United States, the Johnson School of
Management at Cornell was named the 9th best business
school by Forbes in 2019,[146] 8th by The Washington Post for salary potential, 13th overall by Poets and
Quants in 2020[147] but 4th for investment banking[148] and 6th for salary worldwide in 2015,[149] 11th
nationally by Bloomberg Businessweek in 2019,[150] and 11th nationally and 14th worldwide by The
Economist in 2019.[151] In 2013, the Johnson school was ranked 2nd for sustainability by Bloomberg
Businessweek.[152]
Cornell's international relations offerings are also ranked in Foreign Policy magazine's Inside the Ivory Tower
survey, which lists the world's top twenty of such programs at the undergraduate, Master's and Ph.D.
levels.[153] In 2012, the survey ranked Cornell 11th overall for doctoral programs and 12th overall in the
undergraduate category.[154] In 2015, Cornell University was ranked 3rd in New York State by average
professor salaries.[155]

Library
The Cornell University Library is the 11th largest academic library in the United States, ranked by number of
volumes held.[167] Organized into 20 divisions, in 2005 it held 7.5 million printed volumes in open stacks,
8.2 million microfilms and microfiches, and a total of 440,000 maps, motion pictures, DVDs, sound
recordings, and computer files in its collections, in addition to extensive digital resources and the University
Archives.[168] It was the first among all U.S. colleges and universities to allow undergraduates to borrow
books from its libraries.[13] In 2006, The Princeton Review ranked it as the 11th best college library,[169] and it

climbed to 6th best in 2009.[170] The library plays an active role in furthering
online archiving of scientific and historical documents. arXiv, an e-print
archive created at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Paul Ginsparg, is
operated and primarily funded by Cornell as part of the library's services. The
archive has changed the way many physicists and mathematicians
communicate, making the e-print a viable and popular means of announcing
new research.[171]

Press and scholarly publications
The Cornell University Press, established in 1869 but inactive from 1884 to
1930, was the first university publishing enterprise in the United
States.[172][173] Today, the press is one of the country's largest university
presses.[13] It produces approximately 150 nonfiction titles each year in
various disciplines including anthropology, Asian studies, biological sciences,
classics, history, industrial relations, literary criticism and theory, natural
history, politics and international relations, veterinary science, and women's
studies.[173][174]

The Cornell Law Library is
one of 12 national
depositories for print records
of briefs filed with the U.S.
Supreme Court.

Cornell's academic units and student groups also publish a number of scholarly journals. Faculty-led
publications include the Johnson School's Administrative Science Quarterly,[175] the ILR School's Industrial
and Labor Relations Review, the Arts and Sciences Philosophy Department's The Philosophical Review, the
College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's Journal of Architecture, and the Law School's Journal of
Empirical Legal Studies.[176] Student-led scholarly publications include the Law Review, the Cornell Institute
for Public Affairs' Cornell Policy Review, the International Law Journal, the Journal of Law and Public
Policy, the International Affairs Review, and the HR Review. Physical Review, recognized internationally as
among the best and well known journals of physics, was founded at Cornell in 1893 before being later
managed by the American Physical Society.

Research
Cornell, a research university, is ranked fourth in the world in
producing the largest number of graduates who go on to pursue PhDs
in engineering or the natural sciences at American institutions, and
fifth in the world in producing graduates who pursue PhDs at
American institutions in any field.[177] Research is a central element
of the university's mission; in 2009 Cornell spent $671 million on
science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest
in the United States.[178] Cornell is classified among "R1: Doctoral
Universities – Very high research activity".[179]

Cornell's Center for Advanced
Computing was one of the five
original centers of the NSF's
Supercomputer Centers Program.

For the 2016–17 fiscal year, the university spent $984.5 million on
research.[180] Federal sources constitute the largest source of research
funding, with total federal investment of $438.2 million.[181] The
agencies contributing the largest share of that investment are the
Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation, accounting for 49.6% and
24.4% of all federal investment, respectively.[181] Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities receiving
the most patents in 2003, and was one of the nation's top five institutions in forming start-up companies.[182]

In 2004–05, Cornell received 200 invention disclosures, filed 203
U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license
agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to
Cornell units and inventors.[13]
Since 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to
Mars.[183] In the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the Mars
Exploration Rover Mission. Cornell's Steve Squyres, Principal
Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection of the
landing zones and requested data collection features for the Spirit and
Opportunity rovers.[184] Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers took
those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both
of which have operated long past their original life expectancies, are
responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough
of the Year honors by Science.[185] Control of the Mars rovers has
shifted between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and
Cornell's Space Sciences Building.[186] Further, Cornell researchers
discovered the rings around the planet Uranus,[187] and Cornell built
and operated the telescope at Arecibo Observatory located in Arecibo,
Puerto Rico until 2011, when they transferred the operations to SRI
International, the Universities Space Research Association and the
Metropolitan University of Puerto Rico.[188]
The Automotive Crash Injury Research Project was begun in
1952.[189] It pioneered the use of crash testing, originally using
corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered that improved
door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards,
and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of
injuries.[189]

In the early 1980s, Cornell deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to
investigate coarse-grained parallel computing. In 1984, the National Science Foundation began work on
establishing five new supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, to
provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. As an NSF center, Cornell
deployed the first IBM Scalable Parallel supercomputer. In the 1990s, Cornell developed scheduling software
and deployed the first supercomputer built by Dell. Most recently, Cornell deployed Red Cloud, one of the
first cloud computing services designed specifically for research. Today, the center is a partner on the National
Science Foundation Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) supercomputing
program, providing coordination for XSEDE architecture and design, systems reliability testing, and online
training using the Cornell Virtual Workshop learning platform.[190]
Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell
physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated
in the Manhattan Project (see also: List of Cornell Manhattan Project people). In the 1930s, Cornell built the
second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron
radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's
highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.[191][192] After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R.
Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and
building the largest accelerator in the United States.[193] Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups
are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its

construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will
complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark matter and the
existence of extra dimensions.[194]
As part of its research work, Cornell has established several research collaborations with universities around
the globe. For example, a partnership with the University of Sussex (including the Institute of Development
Studies at Sussex) allows research and teaching collaboration between the two institutions.[195]

Student life
Activities
For the 2016–2017 academic year, Cornell had over
1,000 registered student organizations. These clubs and
organizations run the gamut from kayaking to full-armor
jousting, from varsity and club sports and a cappella
groups to improvisational theatre, from political clubs and
publications to chess and video game clubs.[196] The
Cornell International Affairs Society sends over 100
Cornellians to collegiate Model United Nations
conferences across North America and hosts the Cornell
Interior windows of Barton Hall, an on-campus field
Model United Nations Conference each spring for over
house
500 high school students. The Cornell University Mock
Trial Association regularly sends teams to the national
championship and is ranked 5th in the nation.[197]
Additionally, the Cornell International Affairs Society's traveling
Model United Nations team is ranked number 16 in the nation.[198]
Cornell United Religious Work is a collaboration among many
diverse religious traditions, helping to provide spiritual resources
throughout a student's time at college. The Cornell Catholic
Community is the largest Catholic student organization on campus.
Student organizations also include a myriad of groups including a
symphony orchestra,[199] concert bands,[200] formal and informal
choral groups,[201] including the Sherwoods, the Chordials[202] and
The Fuertes Observatory on Cornell's
other musical groups that play everything from classical, jazz, to
North Campus is open to the public
ethnic styles in addition to the Big Red Marching Band, which
every Friday night
performs regularly at football games and other campus events.[203]
Organized in 1868, the oldest Cornell student organization is the
Cornell University Glee Club.[204] Apart from musical groups, Cornell has an active outdoor community,
consisting of Cornell Outdoor Education (https://coe.cornell.edu/), Cornell Outing Club (http://www.cornellout
ingclub.com/), and Outdoor Odyssey (https://odyssey.coe.cornell.edu/), a student-run group that runs preorientation trips for first-year and transfer students. A Cornell student organization, The Cornell Astronomical
Society (http://www.cornellastrosociety.org/), runs public observing nights every Friday evening at the Fuertes
Observatory. The university is home to the Telluride House, an intellectual residential society. The university is
also home to three secret honor societies called Sphinx Head,[205] Der Hexenkreis and Quill and
Dagger[206][207] that have maintained a presence on campus for well over 120 years.
Cornell's clubs are primarily subsidized financially by the Student Assembly and the Graduate & Professional
Student Assembly, two student-run organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million per year.[208][209]
The assemblies also finance other student life programs including a concert commission and an on-campus

theater.

Greek life, professional, and honor societies
Cornell hosts a large and controversial[210][211][212][213][214] fraternity and sorority system, with 70 chapters
involving 33% of male and 24% of female undergraduates.[215][216][217] Alpha Phi Alpha, the first
intercollegiate Greek-letter organization established for African Americans, was founded at Cornell in
1906.[218][219] Alpha Zeta fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in
the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1, 1890. Alpha Zeta served the wealthy
international Latin American students that came to the United States to study. This organization led a
movement of fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 1890 to
1975.[220] On February 19, 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established;[221]
it would eventually become the only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League
institution.[222] Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi sorority was established on April 16, 1988,
making the organization the first Latina-Based, and not Latina exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league
institution.[223]
Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding. Many chapters are among the oldest of
their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of Alpha-series chapters. The chapter
house of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for
fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was designed by John Russell Pope.[224] Philanthropy
opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the
Greek system contributed 21,668 community service and advocacy hours and raised $176,547 in charitable
contributions from its philanthropic efforts.[216] Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek
governing boards. As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by the
Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's justice system.[216]

Press and radio
The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio. Student-run newspapers include
The Cornell Daily Sun, an independent daily; The Cornell Review, a conservative newspaper published
fortnightly; and The Cornell Progressive (newspaper), a liberal newspaper published every month.
Other press outlets include The Cornell Lunatic, a campus humor magazine; the Cornell Chronicle, the
university's newspaper of record; and Kitsch Magazine, a feature magazine published in cooperation with
Ithaca College. The Cornellian is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces,
edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student
life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits. It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a
Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.[225]
Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on WVBR, an independent commercial FM radio station
owned and operated by Cornell students. Other student groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.[226]

Housing
University housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and Collegetown.
Cornell University began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential
advisors (RAs) within the campus system. In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus,
including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus
houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen as
well as sorority and fraternity houses.[227]

The options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the
program houses and co-op houses. Program houses include Risley
Residential College, Just About Music, the Ecology House, Holland
International Living Center, the Multicultural Living Learning Unit,
the Latino Living Center, Akwe:kon, and Ujamaa. The co-op houses
on North are The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait
Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.[228] On
West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660
Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Hall, and Watermargin (https://wate
One of several footbridges that span
rmargin.org/), and one independent cooperative, Cayuga Lodge (htt
Cornell's gorges and ease
p://www.cayugalodge.com/). In an attempt to create a sense of
commuting from housing to
community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and
academic buildings on campus
continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million
reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for
undergraduates.[229] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley
Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.[230] In 2018, Cornell
announced its North Campus Residential Expansive project. By 2022, the university aims to add 2,000 beds
on North Campus. Five new dorms and a dining hall will be created, three of which will be located in Appel
Field and will be exclusive for freshmen. Sophomores will have two new dorms located in the current CC
Parking Lot.[231]
Additionally, Cornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students. Of these, Schuyler
House (which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary)[232] has a dorm layout, while Maplewood Apartments,
Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family
living. Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have
been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in
the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority
houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.[233] Cornell's Greek system has 67
chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students. About 42% of Greek
members live in their houses.[234] Housing cooperatives or other independent living units exist, including
Telluride House, the Center for Jewish Living, Phillips House (located on North Campus, 1975 all women;
2016, all men), and Center for World Community (international community, off campus, formed by Annabel
Taylor Hall, 1972, mixed gender).[235] The cooperative houses on North include The Prospect of Whitby,
Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.[228] On West
Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Cooperative
Hall, and Watermargin (https://watermargin.org/), and one independent cooperative, Cayuga Lodge (http://ww
w.cayugalodge.com/) Besides this, there exists also cooperative housing not owned by Cornell, like Gamma
Alpha or Stewart Little.
As of 2014, Cornell's dining system was ranked 3rd in the nation by the Princeton Review.[236] The university
has 29 on-campus dining locations, including 10 "All You Care to Eat" cafeterias.[237] North Campus is home
to 3 of these dining halls: Robert Purcell Marketplace Eatery (located in Robert Purcell Community Center),
North Star Dining Room (located in the Appel Commons), and Risley Dining (located in Risley Hall).[237]
West Campus houses 6 dining halls, 5 of which accompany the West Campus residential houses: Cook House
Dining Room, Becker House Dining Room, Rose House Dining Room, Jansen's Dining Room at Hans Bethe
House, and Keeton House Dining Room.[237] Also located on West Campus is 104West!, a
kosher/multicultural dining room.[237] Central Campus accommodates just a single dining hall: Okenshields,
located in Willard Straight Hall.[237]

Athletics
Cornell has 36 varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big
Red. An NCAA Division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League
and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference
(ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.[238] (ECAC
Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) Cornell's varsity athletic
teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports,
including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the
women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing
program is governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate
Rowing Association). Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university
does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.[239]
Cornell University's football team had at least a share of the national
championship four times before 1940[240][241] and has won the Ivy League
championship three times, last in 1990.[242]

In 2010, the Cornell men's basketball team appeared for the first time in the
NCAA tournament's East Regional Semifinals, known as the "Sweet 16". It was the first Ivy League team to
make the semifinals since 1979.[243]

Cornell Outdoor Education

Cornell University runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, serving over
20,000 people every year. The program runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to:
Backpacking and Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing,
Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.[244] COE also oversees one of the largest student-run pre-freshman
summer programs, known as Outdoor Odyssey.[245] Most classes are often entirely taught by paid student
instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.[246]
One of the most remarkable facilities at Cornell Outdoor Education is The Lindseth Climbing Wall. The wall
was renovated in 2016, and now includes 8,000 square feet of climbing surface, up from 4,800 square feet
previously.[247] The new wall now offers a more modern environment with bouldering, top-rope, and lead
climbing facilities appropriate for various skill levels.[248]

Cornelliana
Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore.
Cornellian traditions include Slope Day, a celebration held on the last
day of classes of the spring semester, and Dragon Day, which
includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students.
Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been
celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day.
The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting
messages are left for the engineering students for the week before
Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts
Quad and then set afire.[249]
According to legend, if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the
statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their
pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands,
congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also
another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North
Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her
partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is
assured a long future together.[250]
The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on
at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find
something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—
once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball.
Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items
were put in place remains a mystery.[251] The colors of the lights on
McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St.
Patrick's Day.[252] The clock tower also plays music.

A tradition started in 1901, Dragon
Day celebrates a feat by first-year
architecture students to construct a
colossal dragon to be paraded to
center campus and then burned.

The school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on
"Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used
as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the
mascot "Touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.[6] The
university's alma mater is "Far Above Cayuga's Waters", and its fight song is "Give My Regards to Davy".
People associated with the university are called "Cornellians".

Health

Cornell offers a variety of professional and peer counseling services to students.[253] Formerly called Gannett
Health Services until its name change in 2016, Cornell Health offers on-campus outpatient health services with
emergency services and residential treatment provided by Cayuga Medical Center.[254] For most of its history,
Cornell provided residential medical care for sick students, including at the historic Sage Infirmary.[255]
Cornell offers specialized reproductive health and family planning services.[256] The university also has a
student-run Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency. The squad provides emergency response to medical
emergencies on Cornell University campus and surrounding university-owned properties. Cornell EMS also
provides stand-by service for university events and provides CPR, First Aid and other training seminars to the
Cornell community.[257]
The university received worldwide attention for a series of six student suicides by jumping into a gorge that
occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and after the incidents added temporary fences to the bridges which
span area gorges.[258] In May 2013, Cornell indicated that it planned to set up nets, which will extend out 15
feet, on five of the university's bridge.[259] Installation of the nets began in May 2013 and were completed
over the summer of that year.[258] There were cases of gorge-jumping in the 1970s and 1990s.[260] Before this
abnormal cluster of suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates of other
American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 in which no suicides occurred.[261][262]

Campus police
Cornell University Police protect the campus and are classified as peace officers and have the same authority
as the Ithaca city police. They are similar to the campus police at Ithaca College and Syracuse University
because those campus police are classified as armed peace officers. The Cornell University Police are on
campus and on-call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Their duties include: patrolling the university around the
clock, responding to emergencies and non-emergency calls for service, crime prevention services, active
investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement of state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus
regulations.[263]

People
Cornell counts numerous notable individuals who have either come to the university as faculty to teach and to
conduct research, or as students who have gone on to do noteworthy things. As of October 2020, 61 Nobel
laureates were either faculty members, researchers, or students at Cornell.[14]

Faculty
As of 2009, Cornell had 1,639 full-and part-time faculty members
affiliated with its main campus,[13] 1,235 affiliated with its New York
City divisions, and 34 affiliated with its campus in Qatar.[13] Cornell's
faculty for the 2005–06 academic year included three Nobel laureates,
a Crafoord Prize winner, two Turing Award winners, a Fields Medal
winner, two Legion of Honor recipients, a World Food Prize winner,
an Andrei Sakharov Prize winner, three National Medal of Science
winners, two Wolf Prize winners, five MacArthur award winners,
1916 Cornell faculty
four Pulitzer Prize winners, a Carter G. Woodson Scholars Medallion
recipient, 20 National Science Foundation career grant holders, a
recipient of the National Academy of Sciences Award, a recipient of the American Mathematical Society's
Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement, a recipient of the Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, and three
Packard Foundation grant holders.[13]

Kurt Lewin taught at Cornell from 1933 to 1935 and is considered the "father of social psychology".[264]
Norman Borlaug taught at the university from 1982 to 1988 and is considered the "father of the Green

Notes
1. The others are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the publicly funded but "privately
governed" University of Delaware.
2. The University's charter was amended on April 24, 1867, to specify alumni-elected trustees;[21]
however, that provision was not implemented until there were at least 100 alumni[22] in
1872.[23] Also in 1865, the election of the Harvard University Board of Overseers was shifted to
alumni voting.
